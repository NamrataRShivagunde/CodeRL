Children skip the rope at roughly the same speed: `once per second`. If the child fails during the jump, he needs to tidy up the rope and continue. This will take `3 seconds`.\n\nYou are given an array `failedCount`, where each element is the jump count at the failed. ie. `[12,23,45]` means the child failed 3 times in the game process. The 1st mistake occurred when he jumped 12 times; The 2nd mistake occurred when he jumped 23 times; The 3rd mistake occurred when he jumped 45 times.\n\nYour task is to calculate how many times the child jumped in 60 seconds.\n\nNote: Each child persisted at least 60 jumps, which meant it could have been over 60 seconds, but the child continued to skip rope.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n`[input]` integer array `failedCount`\n\n`0 \u2264 failedCount.length \u2264 60`\n\n`1 \u2264 failedCount[i] \u2264 60`\n\n`[output]` an integer\n\nhow many times the child jumped in 60 seconds.\n\n\n# Example\n\nFor `failedCount = []`, the output should be `60`.\n\nThere is no mistake in the game process. So the child jumped 60 times in 60 seconds.\n\nFor `failedCount = [12, 23, 45]`, the output should be `51`.\n```\nThe 1st mistake occurred when he jumped 12 times. --> 12 seconds past.\nTidy up the rope and continue.                    --> 15 seconds past.\nThe 2nd mistake occurred when he jumped 23 times. --> 26 seconds past.\nTidy up the rope and continue.                    --> 29 seconds past.\nThe 3rd mistake occurred when he jumped 45 times. --> 51 seconds past.\nTidy up the rope and continue.                    --> 54 seconds past.\nWhen he jumped 51 times                           --> 60 seconds past.\n```\ndef tiaosheng(failed_counter):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
