string.\nThere was a problem in addition, so many of the date strings are broken.\nDate-Format is european. That means \"DD.MM.YYYY\".\n\n\nSome examples:\n\n\"30.02.2016\" -> \"01.03.2016\"\n\"40.06.2015\" -> \"10.07.2015\"\n\"11.13.2014\" -> \"11.01.2015\"\n\"99.11.2010\" -> \"07.02.2011\"\n\nIf the input-string is null or empty return exactly this value!\nIf the date-string-format is invalid, return null.\n\nHint: Correct first the month and then the day!\n\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\nI have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.\ndef date_correct(date):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
