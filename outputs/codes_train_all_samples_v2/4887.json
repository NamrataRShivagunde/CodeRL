Our last hope in this disaster lies in a shabby time machine built from old toasters and used microwave parts.  \n\nThe World Time Agency requires you to travel back in time to prevent disaster.  You are ordered to \"remove\" certain babies from the timeline.  \n\nHistorical newspapers and records provide the Date, Month, and Year for each mission.  Unfortunately the time machine takes input only as the number of days to travel back in time.  It is your job to calculate how many days you will need to travel back from today's date (March 24, 2437) for each mission.\n\nFor example, if a historical newspaper says a dangerous baby was born on:\nDate = 21, Month = 3, Year = 2437\nThen your function must compute that it was 3 Days ago.\n\nAnother example would be that a baby born on Date = 24, Month = 3, Year = 2436 would have been born 365 days ago.\n\nYou will not have time travel past the year 0.\n\nNote that while this is a fairly simple task, it is complicated by the fact that newspapers used the Julian calendar instead of the current Gregorian calendar prior to September 14, 1752.  In 1752, it was declared that Sep 2, 1752 was proceeded immediately by September 14, 1752, entirely omitting September 3-13. Furthermore, the rules for leap years changed on that date.\n\nAfter 1752, leap years are on any year divisible by four, except for years which are divisible by 100. An exception to that exception is that years divisible by 400 are always leap years.  For example, 1803, 1900, 2001, 2019, and 2100 are not leap years, but 1804, 2000 and 2020 are leap years. \nHowever in the Julian calander prior to and including 1752, leap years were on every year divisible by 4, without the exception of years divisible by 100.  The years 1752, 1700, 1600, and 0 were all leap years.\n\nGood luck agent, the world depends on you!\n\n\nNote: It is not required, but if you find it helpful to visualize the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, please see these links:\n\nPlease observe that much of September 1752 is missing here: https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/?year=1752&country=1\n\nPlease observe that 1700 is a leap year here: https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/?year=1700&country=1\ndef days(date, month, year):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
