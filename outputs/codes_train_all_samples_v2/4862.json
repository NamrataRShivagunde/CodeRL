input:\n - the cat coordinates as a list of length 2, with the row on the map and the column on the map.\n - the map of the room as a list of lists where every element can be 0 if empty or 1 if is the table (there can be only one 1 in the room / lists will never be empty).\n\n# Task:\n\nYou'll need to return the route to the table, beginning from the cat's starting coordinates, as a String. The route must be a sequence of letters U, D, R, L that means Up, Down, Right, Left. The order of the letters in the output isn't important.\n\n# Outputs:\n\n* The route for the cat to reach the table, as a string\n* If there isn't a table in the room you must return \"NoTable\"\n* if the cat is outside of the room you must return \"NoCat\" (this output has the precedence on the above one).\n* If the cat is alredy on the table, you can return an empty String.\n\n# Example: \n\n```\ncat = [0,1]\nroom =[[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,1]]\n\nThe route will be \"RDD\", or \"DRD\" or \"DDR\"\n```\ndef put_the_cat_on_the_table(cat, room):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
