multiply together to get another number.\n\n2 and 3 are factors of 6 because: `2 * 3 = 6`\n\n- You can find a factor by dividing numbers. If the remainder is 0 then the number is a factor.\n- You can use the mod operator (`%`) in most languages to check for a remainder\n\nFor example 2 is not a factor of 7 because: `7 % 2 = 1`\n\nNote: `base` is a non-negative number, `factor` is a positive number.\ndef check_for_factor(base, factor):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
