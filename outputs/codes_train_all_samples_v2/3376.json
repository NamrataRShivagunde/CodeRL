"\nQUESTION:\nThe squarefree part of a positive integer is the largest divisor of that integer which itself has no square factors (other than 1). For example, the squareefree part of 12 is 6, since the only larger divisor is 12, and 12 has a square factor (namely, 4).\n\nYour challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to implement a `squareFreePart` function which accepts a number `n` and returns the squarefree part of `n`. \n\nIn the case that `n = 1`, your function should return 1. Also, if the input doesn't make sense (e.g. if it is not a positive integer), the function should return `null/None`. \n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```python\nsquare_free_part(2) # returns 2\nsquare_free_part(4) # returns 2\nsquare_free_part(24) # returns 6, since any larger divisor is divisible by 4, which is a square\nsquare_free_part(\"hi\") # returns None\nsquare_free_part(0) # returns None\n```\n\nGood luck!\ndef square_free_part(n):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
