You are his secretary, and he has tasked you with writing the code for his newest project - a method for making the short form of a word. Write a function ```shortForm```(C# ```ShortForm```, Python ```short_form```) that takes a string and returns it converted into short form using the rule: Remove all vowels, except for those that are the first or last letter. Do not count 'y' as a vowel, and ignore case. Also note, the string given will not have any spaces; only one word, and only Roman letters. \n\nExample:\n```\nshortForm(\"assault\");\nshort_form(\"assault\")\nShortForm(\"assault\");\n// should return \"asslt\"\n```\n\n \nAlso, FYI: I got all the words with no vowels from \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_words_without_vowels\ndef short_form(s):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
