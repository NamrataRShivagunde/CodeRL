Your task is to write a function that will return the degrees on a analog clock from a digital time that is passed in as parameter . The digital time is type string and will be in the format 00:00 . You also need to return the degrees on the analog clock in type string and format 360:360 . Remember to round of the degrees . Remeber the basic time rules and format like 24:00 = 00:00 and 12:60 = 13:00 . Create your own validation that should return \"Check your time !\" in any case the time is incorrect or the format is wrong , remember this includes passing in negatives times like \"-01:-10\".\n``` \nA few examples :\nclock_degree(\"00:00\") will return : \"360:360\"\nclock_degree(\"01:01\") will return : \"30:6\"\nclock_degree(\"00:01\") will return : \"360:6\"\nclock_degree(\"01:00\") will return : \"30:360\"\nclock_degree(\"01:30\") will return : \"30:180\"\nclock_degree(\"24:00\") will return : \"Check your time !\"\nclock_degree(\"13:60\") will return : \"Check your time !\"\nclock_degree(\"20:34\") will return : \"240:204\"\n```\nRemember that discrete hour hand movement is required - snapping to each hour position and also coterminal angles are not allowed.
