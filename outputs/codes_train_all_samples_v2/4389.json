He used a special accounting method, like this:\n```\n[[60,20],[60,-20]]\n```\nEach sub array records the commodity price and profit/loss to sell (percentage). Positive mean profit and negative means loss.\n\nIn the example above, John's first commodity sold at a price of $60, he made a profit of 20%; Second commodities are sold at a price of $60 too, but he lost 20%.\n\nPlease calculate, whether his account is profit or loss in the end?\n    \n## Rules\n\nWrite a function ```profitLoss```, argument ```records``` is the list of sales.\n\nreturn a number(positive or negative), round to two decimal places.\n    \n\n## Examples\ndef profitLoss(records):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
