It's the number of candy for each child:\n ```\n candies = [10,2,8,22,16,4,10,6,14,20]\n ```\n The teacher asked the children to form a circle and play a game: Each child gives half of his candies to the child on his right(at the same time). If the number of children's candy is an odd number, the teacher will give him an extra candy, so that he can evenly distribute his candy. \n \n Repeat such distribute process, until all the children's candies are equal in number.\n \n You should return two numbers: 1.How many times of distribution; 2. After the game, the number of each child's candy. Returns the result using an array that contains two elements.\n \n  \n# Some examples:\n\n```\n      candies = [ 1,2,3,4,5 ]\nDistribution 1: [ 4,2,3,4,5 ]\nDistribution 2: [ 5,3,3,4,5 ]\nDistribution 3: [ 6,5,4,4,5 ]\nDistribution 4: [ 6,6,5,4,5 ]\nDistribution 5: [ 6,6,6,5,5 ]\nDistribution 6: [ 6,6,6,6,6 ]\nSo, we need return: [6,6]\n\ndistributionOfCandy([1,2,3,4,5]) === [6,6]\n\n       candies = [ 10,  2,  8, 22, 16,  4, 10,  6, 14, 20 ]\ndistribution  1: [ 15,  6,  5, 15, 19, 10,  7,  8, 10, 17 ]\ndistribution  2: [ 17, 11,  6, 11, 18, 15,  9,  8,  9, 14 ]\ndistribution  3: [ 16, 15,  9,  9, 15, 17, 13,  9,  9, 12 ]\ndistribution  4: [ 14, 16, 13, 10, 13, 17, 16, 12, 10, 11 ]\ndistribution  5: [ 13, 15, 15, 12, 12, 16, 17, 14, 11, 11 ]\ndistribution  6: [ 13, 15, 16, 14, 12, 14, 17, 16, 13, 12 ]\ndistribution  7: [ 13, 15, 16, 15, 13, 13, 16, 17, 15, 13 ]\ndistribution  8: [ 14, 15, 16, 16, 15, 14, 15, 17, 17, 15 ]\ndistribution  9: [ 15, 15, 16, 16, 16, 15, 15, 17, 18, 17 ]\ndistribution 10: [ 17, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 17, 18, 18 ]\ndistribution 11: [ 18, 17, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 17, 18, 18 ]\ndistribution 12: [ 18, 18, 17, 16, 16, 16, 16, 17, 18, 18 ]\ndistribution 13: [ 18, 18, 18, 17, 16, 16, 16, 17, 18, 18 ]\ndistribution 14: [ 18, 18, 18, 18, 17, 16, 16, 17, 18, 18 ]\ndistribution 15: [ 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 17, 16, 17, 18, 18 ]\ndistribution 16: [ 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 17, 17, 18, 18 ]\ndistribution 17: [ 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18 ]\nSo, we need return: [17,18]\n\ndistributionOfCandy([10,2,8,22,16,4,10,6,14,20]) === [17,18]\n\n```\ndef distribution_of_candy(candies):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
