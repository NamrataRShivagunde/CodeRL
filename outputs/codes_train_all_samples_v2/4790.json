To this aim, your function will receive a list of numbers representing a sample of data. Your function must remove any outliers and return the mean of the sample, rounded to two decimal places (round only at the end).\n\nSince there is no objective definition of \"outlier\" in statistics, your function will also receive a cutoff, in standard deviation units. So for example if the cutoff is 3, then any value that is more than 3 standard deviations above or below the mean must be removed. Notice that, once outlying values are removed in a first \"sweep\", other less extreme values may then \"become\" outliers, that you'll have to remove as well!\nExample :\n```python\nsample = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 100]\ncutoff = 3\nclean_mean(sample, cutoff) \u2192 5.5\n```\n\nFormula for the mean :\n\n(where n is the sample size)\n\nFormula for the standard deviation :\n\n(where N is the sample size, xi is observation i and x\u0304 is the sample mean)\n\nNote : since we are not computing the sample standard deviation for inferential purposes, the denominator is n, not n - 1.\ndef clean_mean(sample, cutoff):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
