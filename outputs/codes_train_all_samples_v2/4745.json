One day, your boss walks in and asks, \"Why are we just randomly placing the items everywhere? It's too difficult to find anything in this place!\" Now's your chance to improve the system, impress your boss, and get that raise!\n\nThe input is a comma-separated list with category as the prefix in the form `\"fruit_banana\"`. Your task is to group each item into the 4 categories `Fruit, Meat, Other, Vegetable` and output a string with a category on each line followed by a sorted comma-separated list of items.\n\nFor example, given:\n\n```\n\"fruit_banana,vegetable_carrot,fruit_apple,canned_sardines,drink_juice,fruit_orange\"\n```\n\noutput:\n\n```\n\"fruit:apple,banana,orange\\nmeat:\\nother:juice,sardines\\nvegetable:carrot\"\n```\n\nAssume that:\n1.
