You haven't decided on the dimensions of your piece, how large you want your pixels to be, or which wall you want to use. You just know that you want to fit an exact number of pixels.\n\nTo help decide those things you've decided to write a function, `is_divisible()` that will tell you whether a wall of a certain length can exactly fit an integer number of pixels of a certain length.\n\nYour function should take two arguments: the size of the wall in millimeters and the size of a pixel in millimeters. It should return `True` if you can fit an exact number of pixels on the wall, otherwise it should return `False`. For example `is_divisible(4050, 27)` should return `True`, but `is_divisible(4066, 27)` should return `False`.\n\nNote: you don't need to use an `if` statement here. Remember that in Python an expression using the `==` comparison operator will evaluate to either `True` or `False`:\n```python\n>>> def equals_three(num):\n>>>     return num == 3\n>>> equals_three(5)\nFalse\n>>> equals_three(3)\nTrue\n```\n\n\n```if:csharp\nDocumentation:\nKata.IsDivisible Method (Int32, Int32)\n\nReturns a boolean representing if the first argument is perfectly divisible by the second argument.\n\nSyntax\n\n\npublic\nstatic\nbool IsDivisible(\nint wallLength,\n  \u00a0\u00a0int pixelSize,\n  \u00a0\u00a0)\n  \n\n\n\nParameters\n\nwallLength\n\nType: System.Int32\nThe length of the wall in millimeters.\n\npixelSize\n\nType: System.Int32\nThe length of a pixel in millimeters.\n\nReturn Value\n\nType: System.Boolean\n  A boolean value representing if the first argument is perfectly divisible by the second.\n\n```\ndef is_divisible(wall_length, pixel_size):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
