And in Lemmings Planet a huge battle\nis being fought between the two great rival races: the green\nlemmings and the blue lemmings. Everybody was now assigned\nto battle and they will fight until one of the races completely\ndissapears: the Deadly War has begun!\n\nEvery single lemming has a power measure that describes its\nability to fight. When two single lemmings fight with each one,\nthe lemming with more power survives and the other one dies.\nHowever, the power of the living lemming gets smaller after the\nfight, exactly in the value of the power of the lemming that died.\nFor example, if we have a green lemming with power ``50`` and a\nblue lemming with power ``40``, the blue one dies and the green one\nsurvives, but having only power 10 after the battle ``(50-40=10)``.\nIf two lemmings have the same power when they fight, both of\nthem die.\n\nIn the fight between the two races, there are a certain number of battlefields. Each race assigns one\nlemming for each battlefield, starting with the most powerful. So for example, if a race has 5 lemmings\nwith power ```{50, 50, 40, 40, 30}``` and we have `3` battlefields, then a lemming with power `50` will be assigned\nto battlefield 1, another with `50` power will be assigned to battlefield 2 and last a lemming with power `40` will go to battlefield 3. The other race will do the same.\n\nThe Deadly War is processed by having each race send its best soldiers as described to the battle-\nfields, making a battle round. Then, all battles process at the same time, and some of the lemmings\nwill emerge victorious (but with less power) and some of them will die. The surviving ones will return to their race\u2019s army and then a new round will begin, with each race sending again its best remaining soldiers to the battlefields. If at some point a race does not have enough soldiers to fill all battlefields, then only the ones with soldiers from both races will have a fight.\n\nThe Deadly War ends when one of the races has no more lemmings or when both of them disappear\nat the same time. For example, imagine a war with 2 battlefields and a green army with powers `{20,10}` and a blue army with powers `{10, 10, 15}`. The first round will have `20 vs 15` in battlefield 1 and `10 vs 10` in battlefield 2. After these battles, green race will still have a power `5` lemming (that won on battlefield 1) and blue race will have one with power 10 (that did not fight). The ones in battlefield 2\ndied, since they both had the same power. Afer that comes a second round, and only battlefield 1 will have a fight, being `5 vs 10`. The blue lemming wins, killing the last green soldier and giving the victory to the blue race!\n\nBut in the real battle, will victory be green or blue?\n\nGiven the number of battefields and the armies of both races, your task is to discover which race\nwill win the Deadly War and show the power of the surviving soldiers.\n\n## Input\n\nYou are given B, SG and SB, representing respectively the number of battlefields available, a vector of integers size `n` of lemmings in the green army \nand a vector of integers size `n` of lemmings in the blue army  (1 \u2264 B, SG, SB \u2264 100000).\n\nThe lemmings in each army do not need to come in any particular order.\n\n## Output\nFor each test case you should return :\n\n\u2022 \"Green and Blue died\" if both races died in the same round\n\n\u2022 \"Green wins : Each surviving soldier in descending order\" if the green army won the Deadly War\n\n\u2022 \"Blue wins : Each surviving soldier in descending order\" if the blue army won the Deadly War\n\n## Example\n\n```python\nlemming_battle(5, [10], [10]) == \"Green and Blue died\"\nlemming_battle(2, [20,10], [10,10,15]) == \"Blue wins: 5\"\nlemming_battle(3, [50,40,30,40,50], [50,30,30,20,60]) == \"Green wins: 10 10\"\n```\ndef lemming_battle(battlefield, green, blue):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
