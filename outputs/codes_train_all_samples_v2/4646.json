This series is meant to test our coding knowledge.*\n\n## Ciphers #1 - The 01 Cipher\nThis cipher doesn't exist, I just created it by myself. It can't actually be used, as there isn't a way to decode it. It's a hash. Multiple sentences may also have the same result.\n\n## How this cipher works\nIt looks at the letter, and sees it's index in the alphabet, the alphabet being `a-z`, if you didn't know. If it is odd, it is replaced with `1`, if it's even, its replaced with `0`. Note that the index should start from 0. Also, if the character isn't a letter, it remains the same.\n\n## Example\n\nThis is because `H`'s index is `7`, which is odd, so it is replaced by `1`, and so on.\n\nHave fun (en)coding!\ndef encode(s):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
