These are called **production rules** and can be derived into many different tools. One of them is **String Rewriting Systems** (also called Semi-Thue Systems or Markov Algorithms). Ignoring technical details, they are a set of rules that substitute ocurrences in a given string by other strings. \n\nThe rules have the following format:\n\n```\nstr1 -> str2\n```\n\nWe define a rule application as the substitution of a substring following a rule. If this substring appears more than once, only one of this occurences is substituted and any of them is equally valid as an option:\n\n```python\n'a' -> 'c' # Substitution rule\n\n'aba' # Base string\n'cba' # One application on position 0\n'abc' # One application on position 2\n'cbc' # Two applications\n```\n\nAnother valid example of rule application would be the following:\n\n```python\n# Rules\n'l' -> 'de'\n'm' -> 'col'\n'rr' -> 'wakr'\n'akr' -> 'ars'\n\n# Application\n'mrr' # Starting string\n'colrr' # Second rule\n'coderr' # First rule\n'codewakr' # Third rule\n'codewars' # Last rule \n```\nNote that this example is exhaustive, but Semi-Thue Systems can be potentially infinite:\n\n```python\n# Rules\n'a' -> 'aa'\n\n# Application\n'a' # Starting string\n'aa' # First application\n'aaa' # Second application\n...\n```\n\nThe so called **Word Problem** is to decide whether or not a string can be derived from another using these rules. This is an **undecidable problem**, but if we restrict it to a certain number of applications, we can give it a solution.\n\nYour task is to write a function that solves the word problem given a maximum number of rule applications. \n\n**Python:** The rules are given as tuples where the left and the right handside of the rule correspond to the first and the second element respectively.\n\n**Notes:** \n* Two rules can have the same left handside and a different right handside.\n* You do not have to worry too much about performance yet. A simple, funtional answer will be enough.\ndef word_problem(rules:\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
