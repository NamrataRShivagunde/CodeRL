However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.\n\n### Task Overview:\n\nYou have to write a function that accepts three parameters: \n* `cap` is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.\n* `on` is the number of people on the bus.\n* `wait` is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus. \n\nIf there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.\n\n### Usage Examples:\n\n```python\nenough(10, 5, 5)\n0 # He can fit all 5 passengers\nenough(100, 60, 50)\n10 # He can't fit 10 out of 50 waiting\n```\n\n```if:csharp\nDocumentation:\nKata.Enough Method (Int32, Int32, Int32)\n\nReturns the number of passengers the bus cannot fit, or 0 if the bus can fit every passenger.\n\nSyntax\n\n\npublic\nstatic\nint Enough(\nint cap,\n  \u00a0\u00a0int on,\nint wait\n  \u00a0\u00a0)\n  \n\n\n\nParameters\n\ncap\n\nType: System.Int32\nThe amount of people that can fit on the bus excluding the driver.\n\non\n\nType: System.Int32\nThe amount of people on the bus excluding the driver.\n\nwait\n\nType: System.Int32\nThe amount of people waiting to enter the bus.\n\nReturn Value\n\nType: System.Int32\n  An integer representing how many passengers cannot fit on the bus, or 0 if every passenger can fit on the bus.\n\n```\ndef enough(cap, on, wait):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
