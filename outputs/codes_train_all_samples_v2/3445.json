The two numbers 4 and 8 sum to 12 and have a gcd of 4.\n\nsolve(12,5) = -1. No two numbers exist that sum to 12 and have gcd of 5.\n\nsolve(10,2) = [2,8]. Note that [4,6] is also a possibility but we pick the one with the lower first element: 2 < 4, so we take [2,8].\n```\n\nMore examples in test cases. \n\nGood luck!\ndef solve(s,g):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
