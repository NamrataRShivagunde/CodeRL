It should be expressed as an integer, (no L for long type \n      variables)\n\n(3) - Real Number of triangles that can be formed with the given points. (The function should have a \n      counter for all the cases of three points aligned). It should be expressedas as an integer.\n\n(4) - The triangles that have maximum area in a sorted list. \n      If there are two triangles with the biggest area, the result will be presented in this way:\n      [[[xA1, yA1], [xB1, yB1], [xC1, yC1]], [[xA2, yA2], [xB2, yB2], [xC2, yC2]]]\n      But if we have only one triangle with max. area, there is no need of a spare level of braces, \n      so it will be as follows: [[xA1, yA1], [xB1, yB1], [xC1, yC1]]\n\n(5) - The value of max. area (absolute value) that was found as a float. As we did not define the \n      units of length for the coordinates, the units for the area will be ignored.\n\n```\n\nIt would be useful to apply the expression for the area of a triangle with vertices A, B, and C, is equal to the half of the determinant of the matrix, using the respective coordinates as follows:\n\n```python\n\n                               | xA    yA    1|\nArea Triangle(A, B, C) = 1/2 . | xB    yB    1|\n                               | xC    yC    1|\n\n```\nThe negative sign for the area should be ignored for the purpose of the exercise, and we will consider the absolute value for all cases.\n\nSee how to calculate the determinant of a matrix 3 x 3, rule of Sarrus.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_Sarrus\n\nUsing this expression, it would be easy to detect the cases when three points are aligned.\n\nLet's see some simple cases.\n```python\nlistOfPoints1 = [(0, 1), (7, 3), (9, 0), (7, 10), (2, 9), (10, 7), (2, 8), (9, 8), (4, 4), (2, 10), (10, 1), (0, 4), (4, 3), (10, 0), (0, 3), (3, 4), (1, 1), (7, 2), (4, 0)] (19 points received)\n\nfind_biggTriang(listOfPoints1) --------> [19, 969, 953, [[0, 1], [7, 10], [10, 0]], 48.5]\n\n/// Combinations (19, 3) = 969 (We do not have repeated points)\n   953 real cases for triangles because the function detected 16 cases when three points are       \n   aligned.\n   The function found one triangle [[0, 1], [7, 10], [10, 0]] with its area equals to 49.5///\n\nlistOfPoints2 = [(7, 4), (0, 0), (9, 10), (5, 0), (8, 1), (7, 6), (9, 3), (2, 4), (6, 3), (5, 6), (3, 6), (10, 0), (9, 7), (3, 10), (10, 2)] (15 points received)\n\nfind_biggTriang(listOfPoints2) --------> [15, 455, 446, [[[0, 0], [9, 10], [10, 0]], [[0, 0], [10, 0], [3, 10]]], 50.0]\n\n/// Combinations(15, 3) = 455 but there were only 446 real triangles\n   We found two triangles: [[0, 0], [9, 10], [10, 0]] and [[0, 0], [10, 0], [3, 10]] (both in a \n   sorted list. Both triangles have an area of 50.0///\n```\nYour code will be tested with lists created randomly up to 70 points.\n\nHave a nice moment and enjoy it!!\ndef find_biggTriang(points):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
