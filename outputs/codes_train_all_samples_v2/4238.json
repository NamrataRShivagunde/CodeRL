of you are familiar with the ancient legend of the rice (but I see wikipedia suggests [wheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_and_chessboard_problem), for some reason) problem, but a quick recap for you: a young man asks as a compensation only `1` grain of rice for the first square, `2` grains for the second, `4` for the third, `8` for the fourth and so on, always doubling the previous.\n\nYour task is pretty straightforward (but not necessarily easy): given an amount of grains, you need to return up to which square of the chessboard one should count in order to get at least as many.\n\nAs usual, a few examples might be way better than thousands of words from me:\n\n```python\nsquares_needed(0) == 0\nsquares_needed(1) == 1\nsquares_needed(2) == 2\nsquares_needed(3) == 2\nsquares_needed(4) == 3\n```\n\nInput is always going to be valid/reasonable: ie: a non negative number; extra cookie for *not* using a loop to compute square-by-square (at least not directly) and instead trying a smarter approach [hint: some peculiar operator]; a trick converting the number might also work: impress me!\ndef squares_needed(grains):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
