Unfortunately, he is too young to buy his own cigarettes and that's why he has to be extremely efficient in smoking.\n\nIt's now your task to create a function that calculates how many cigarettes Timothy can smoke out of the given amounts of `bars` and `boxes`:\n\n- a bar has 10 boxes of cigarettes,\n- a box has 18 cigarettes,\n- out of 5 stubs (cigarettes ends) Timothy is able to roll a new one,\n- of course the self made cigarettes also have an end which can be used to create a new one...\n\nPlease note that Timothy never starts smoking cigarettes that aren't \"full size\" so the amount of smoked cigarettes is always an integer.\ndef start_smoking(bars,boxes):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
