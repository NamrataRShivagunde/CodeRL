Doing that, perhaps, it will help us to make all the flood of palindrome programming challenges more understandable.\n\nFor example all the integers of 1 digit (not including 0) are palindromes, 9 cases.\nWe have nine of them with two digits, so the total amount of palidromes below ```100``` (10^(2)) is ```18```.\nAt least, will we be able to calculate the amount of them for a certain number of digits?\nLet's say for ```2000``` digits?\nPrepare a code that given the number of digits ```n```, may output the amount of palindromes of length equals to n and the total amount of palindromes below 10^(n).\n\nYou will see more examples in the box.\nHappy coding!!\n\n(You don't know what palindromes are?
