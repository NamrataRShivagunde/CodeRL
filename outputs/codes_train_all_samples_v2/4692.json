You ___need___ to make profit... Or at least, you need to lose the least amount of money!  \nKnowing a list of prices for buy/sell operations, you need to pick two of them. Buy/sell market is evolving across time and the list represent this evolution. First, you need to buy one item, then sell it later. Find the best profit you can do.\n\n### Example:\n\nGiven an array of prices `[3, 10, 8, 4]`, the best profit you could make would be `7` because you buy at `3` first, then sell at `10`.\n\n# Input:\n\nA list of prices (integers), of length 2 or more.\n\n# Output:\n\nThe result of the best buy/sell operation, as an integer.\n\n\n\n### Note:\nBe aware you'll face lists with several thousands of elements, so think about performance.\ndef max_profit(prices):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
