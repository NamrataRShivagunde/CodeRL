CS, Go) \n- or as two strings (example: \"2\" \"3\" in Haskell, Java, CSharp, C++, Swift) \n- or as a rational or decimal number (example: 3/4, 0.67 in R) \n- or two integers (Fortran)\n\ndecompose \nthis number as a sum of rationals with numerators equal to one and without repetitions\n(2/3 = 1/2 + 1/6 is correct but not 2/3 = 1/3 + 1/3, 1/3 is repeated).\n    \nThe algorithm must be \"greedy\", so at each stage the new rational obtained in the decomposition must have a denominator as small as possible. \nIn this manner the sum of a few fractions in the decomposition gives a rather good approximation of the rational to decompose.\n    \n2/3 = 1/3 + 1/3 doesn't fit because of the repetition but also because the first 1/3 has a denominator bigger than the one in 1/2 \nin the decomposition 2/3 = 1/2 + 1/6.\n    \n### Example: \n(You can see other examples in \"Sample Tests:\")\n```\ndecompose(\"21/23\") or \"21\" \"23\" or 21/23 should return \n\n[\"1/2\", \"1/3\",

equal to one, in which case the first \"fraction\" will be an integer \n(with an implicit denominator of 1). \n\n3) If the numerator parses to zero the function \"decompose\" returns [] (or \"\".\n\n4) The number could also be a decimal which can be expressed as a rational. \n\nexamples:\n\n`0.6` in Ruby, Python, Clojure,JS, CS, Julia, Go\n  \n`\"66\" \"100\"` in Haskell, Java, CSharp,
