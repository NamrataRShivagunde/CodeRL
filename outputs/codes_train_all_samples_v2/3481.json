alphabetically e.g:\n\n```python\nget_char_count(\"cba\") == {1: [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]}\n```\n\nYou should ignore spaces, special characters and count uppercase letters as lowercase ones.\n\nFor example: \n```python\nget_char_count(\"Mississippi\")           ==  {4: [\"i\", \"s\"], 2: [\"p\"], 1: [\"m\"]}\nget_char_count(\"Hello.
