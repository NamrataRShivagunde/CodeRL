"\nQUESTION:\nWe have the integer `9457`. \n\nWe distribute its digits in two buckets having the following possible distributions (we put the generated numbers as strings and we add the corresponding formed integers for each partition):\n```\n- one bucket with one digit and the other with three digits \n[['9'], ['4','5','7']] --> ['9','457'] --> 9 + 457 = 466\n[['9','5','7'], ['4']] --> ['957','4'] --> 957 + 4 = 961\n[['9','4','7'], ['5']] --> ['947','5'] --> 947 + 5 = 952\n[['9','4','5'], ['7']] --> ['945','7'] --> 945 + 7 = 952\n\n- two buckets with 2 digits each:\n[['9','4'], ['5','7']] --> ['94','57'] --> 94 + 57 = 151\n[['9','5'], ['4','7']] --> ['95','47'] --> 95 + 47 = 142\n[['9','7'], ['4','5']] --> ['97','45'] --> 97 + 45 = 142\n```\n\nNow we distribute the digits of that integer in three buckets, and we do the same presentation as above:\n```\none bucket of two digits and two buckets with one digit each:\n[['9'], ['4'], ['5','7']] --> ['9','4','57'] --> 9 + 4 + 57 = 70\n[['9','4'], ['5'], ['7']] --> ['94','5','7'] --> 94 + 5 + 7 = 106\n[['9'], ['4', '5'], ['7']] --> ['9','45','7'] --> 9 + 45 + 7 = 61\n[['9'], ['5'], ['4','7']] --> ['9','5','47'] --> 9 + 5 + 47 = 61\n[['9','5'], ['4'], ['7']] --> ['95','4','7'] --> 95 + 4 + 7 = 106\n[['9','7'], ['4'], ['5']] --> ['97','4','5'] --> 97 + 4 + 5 = 106\n```\nFinally we distribute the digits in the maximum possible amount of buckets for this integer, four buckets, with an unique distribution:\n```\nOne digit in each bucket.\n[['9'], ['4'], ['5'], ['7']] --> ['9','4','5','7'] --> 9 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 25\n```\nIn the distribution we can observe the following aspects:\n\n- the order of the buckets does not matter\n\n- the order of the digits in each bucket matters; the available digits have the same order than in the original number.\n\n- the amount of buckets varies from two up to the amount of digits\n\nThe function, `f =` `bucket_digit_distributions_total_sum`, gives for each integer, the result of the big sum of the total addition of generated numbers for each distribution of digits.\n```python\nbucket_digit_distributions_total_sum(9457) === 4301 # 466 + 961 + 952 + 952 + 151 + 142 + 142 + 70 + 106 + 61 + 61 + 106 + 106 + 25 = 4301\n```\nIt is interesting to see the value of this function for a number that has one or more zeroes as digits, for example:\n```python\nbucket_digit_distributions_total_sum(10001) === 5466\n```\nGiven an integer `n`, with its corresponding value of the above function, `f(n)`, and another integer `z`, find the closest and higher integer to n, `nf`, such `f(nf) > f(n) + z`.\n\nExample:\n```python\nfind(10001,100) === 10003\nfind(30000, 1000) === 30046\n``` \nFeatures of the random tests:\n```\n100 <= n <= 1500000\n50 <= z <= 6000\n```\ndef find(n,z):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
