they get slower... they get dumber... they are only able to solve 1 less Kata than they could the previous day.\n\nFor example, if they can solve 10 Kata today, then tomorrow they can solve only 9 Kata, then 8, 7, 6... Eventually they can't do much more than sit around all day playing video games.\n\nAnd (unlike me), when the clone cannot solve any more Kata they are no longer clever enough to operate the clone machine either!\n\n# The Return Home\n\nI suspected something was wrong when I noticed my **Codewars** honour had stopped rising.\n\nI made a hasty return home...\n\n...and found 100s of clones scattered through the house. Mostly they sit harmlessly mumbling to themselves. The largest group have made a kind of nest in my loungeroom where they sit catatonic in front of the PlayStation.\n\nThe whole place needs fumigating.\n\nThe fridge and pantry are empty.\n\nAnd I can't find the cat.\n\n# Kata Task\n\nWrite a method to predict the final outcome where:\n\nInput:\n\n* `kata-per-day` is the number of Kata I can solve per day\n\nOutput:\n\n* ```[number-of-clones, number-of-kata-solved-by-clones]```\ndef clonewars(n):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
