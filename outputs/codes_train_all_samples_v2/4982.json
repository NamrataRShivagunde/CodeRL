It was first published in the 19th century by \u00c9douard Lucas, who called it la pipopipette. It has gone by many other names, including the game of dots, boxes, dot to dot grid, and pigs in a pen.\n\nStarting with an empty grid of dots, two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. The player who completes the fourth side of a 1\u00d71 box earns one point and takes another turn only if another box can be made. (A point is typically recorded by placing a mark that identifies the player in the box, such as an initial). The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner is the player with the most points. The board may be of any size. When short on time, a 2\u00d72 board (a square of 9 dots) is good for beginners. A 5\u00d75 is good for experts. (Source Wikipedia)\n\n\n\n# Task\n\n\nYour task is to complete the class called Game. You will be given the board size as an integer board that will be between 1 and 26, therefore the game size will be board x board. You will be given an array of lines that have already been taken, so you must complete all possible squares.\n\n\n# Rules\n\n1.\u00a0 The integer board will be passed when the class is initialised.\n\n2.\u00a0 board will be between 1 and 26.\n\n3.\u00a0 The lines array maybe empty or contain a list of line integers.\n\n4.\u00a0 You can only complete a square if 3 out of the 4 sides are already complete.\n\n5.\u00a0 The lines array that is passed into the play() function may not be sorted numerically!\n\n\n# Returns\n\nReturn an array of all the lines filled in including the original lines.\n\nReturn array must be sorted numerically.\n\nReturn array must not contain duplicate integers.\n\n\n# Example 1\n## Initialise\nInitialise a board of 2 squares by 2 squares where ```board = 2```\n\n## Line Numbering\n\n\n## Line Input\nSo for the line input of `[1, 3, 4]` the below lines would be complete\n\nto complete the square line `6` is needed\n## Game Play\n```python\nboard = 2\nlines = [1, 3, 4]\ngame = Game(board)\ngame.play(lines) => [1, 3, 4, 6]\n```\n\n# Example 2\n## Initialise\n```python\nboard = 2\nlines = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12]\ngame = Game.new(board)\ngame.play(lines) => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\n```\n## Solution \n\n\nGood luck and enjoy!\n\n# Kata Series\nIf you enjoyed this, then please try one of my other Katas.
