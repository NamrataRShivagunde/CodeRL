You've each decided to add some amazing new features to your robot and automate them to battle to the death.\n\nEach robot will be represented by an object. You will be given two robot objects, and an object of battle tactics and how much damage they produce. Each robot will have a name, hit points, speed, and then a list of battle tacitcs they are to perform in order. Whichever robot has the best speed, will attack first with one battle tactic. \n\nYour job is to decide who wins.\n\nExample:\n```python\n robot_1 = {\n  \"name\": \"Rocky\",\n  \"health\": 100,\n  \"speed\": 20,\n  \"tactics\": [\"punch\", \"punch\", \"laser\", \"missile\"]\n }\n robot_2 = {\n   \"name\": \"Missile Bob\",\n   \"health\": 100,\n   \"speed\": 21,\n   \"tactics\": [\"missile\", \"missile\", \"missile\", \"missile\"]\n }\n tactics = {\n   \"punch\": 20,\n   \"laser\": 30,\n   \"missile\": 35\n }\n \n fight(robot_1, robot_2, tactics) -> \"Missile Bob has won the fight.\"\n```\n\nrobot2 uses the first tactic, \"missile\" because he has the most speed. This reduces robot1's health by 35. Now robot1 uses a punch, and so on. \n\n**Rules**\n\n- A robot with the most speed attacks first. If they are tied, the first robot passed in attacks first.\n- Robots alternate turns attacking. Tactics are used in order.\n- A fight is over when a robot has 0 or less health or both robots have run out of tactics.\n- A robot who has no tactics left does no more damage, but the other robot may use the rest of his tactics.\n- If both robots run out of tactics, whoever has the most health wins. Return the message \"{Name} has won the fight.\"\n- If both robots run out of tactics and are tied for health, the fight is a draw. Return \"The fight was a draw.\"\n\n**To Java warriors**\n\n`Robot` class is immutable.\n\n\nCheck out my other 80's Kids Katas:\n\n\n80's Kids #1: How Many Licks Does It Take\n80's Kids #2: Help Alf Find His Spaceship\n80's Kids #3: Punky Brewster's Socks\n80's Kids #4: Legends of the Hidden Temple\n80's Kids #5: You Can't Do That on Television\n80's Kids #6: Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em Robots\n80's Kids #7: She's a Small Wonder\n80's Kids #8: The Secret World of Alex Mack\n80's Kids #9: Down in Fraggle Rock \n80's Kids #10: Captain Planet\ndef fight(robot_1, robot_2, tactics):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
