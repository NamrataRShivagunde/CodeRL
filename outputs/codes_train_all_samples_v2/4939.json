Eventually it will probably kill me.\n\n*Or will it..?*\n\nAnyway, there's no way to know.\n\n*Or is there...?*\n\n\n# The Discovery of the Formula \n\nI proudly announce my discovery of a formula for measuring the life-span of coffee drinkers!\n\nFor\n\n* ```h``` is a health number assigned to each person (8 digit date of birth YYYYMMDD)\n\n\n* ```CAFE``` is a cup of *regular* coffee\n\n\n* ```DECAF``` is a cup of *decaffeinated* coffee\n\n\nTo determine the life-time coffee limits:\n\n* Drink cups of coffee (i.e. add to ```h```) until any part of the health number includes `DEAD`\n\n\n* If the test subject can survive drinking five thousand cups wihout being ```DEAD``` then coffee has no ill effect on them\n\n# Kata Task\n\nGiven the test subject's date of birth, return an array describing their life-time coffee limits\n\n```[ regular limit , decaffeinated limit ]```\n\n## Notes \n\n* The limits are ```0``` if the subject is unaffected as described above\n\n* At least 1 cup must be consumed (Just thinking about coffee cannot kill you!)\n\n# Examples\n\n* John was born 19/Jan/1950 so ```h=19500119```. His coffee limits are ```[2645, 1162]``` which is only about 1 cup per week. You better cut back John...How are you feeling? You don't look so well.\n\n\n* Susan (11/Dec/1965) is unaffected by decaffeinated coffee, but regular coffee is very bad for her ```[111, 0]```. Just stick to the decaf Susan.\n\n\n* Elizabeth (28/Nov/1964) is allergic to decaffeinated coffee. Dead after only 11 cups ```[0, 11]```. Read the label carefully Lizzy! Is it worth the risk?\n\n\n* Peter (4/Sep/1965) can drink as much coffee as he likes ```[0, 0]```. You're a legend Peter!!\n\n\n\nHint: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal \n\n\n\n*Note: A life-span prediction formula this accurate has got to be worth a lot of money to somebody!
