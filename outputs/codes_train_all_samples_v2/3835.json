mixed all the prices (initial and discounted), so now he needs your cool coding skills to filter out only the discounted prices.\n\nFor example, consider this inputs:\n```\n\"15 20 60 75 80 100\"\n\"9 9 12 12 12 15 16 20\"\n```\nThey should output:\n```\n\"15 60 75\"\n\"9 9 12 15\"\n```\nEvery input will always have all the prices in pairs (initial and discounted) sorted from smaller to bigger.\n\nYou might have noticed that the second sample input can be tricky already; also, try to have an eye for performances, as huge inputs could be tested too.\n\n***Final Note:*** kata blatantly taken from [this problem](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/8274486/dashboard) (and still not getting why they created a separated Code Jam for ladies, as I find it rather discriminating...), this kata was created inspired by two of the talented girls I am coaching thanks to [codebar](https://codebar.io/) :)\ndef find_discounted(prices):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
