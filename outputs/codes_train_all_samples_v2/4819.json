So, every now and then, when your mother didn't see you, you sneaked into the kitchen, climbed onto a stool to reach the cookie jar, and stole a cookie or two. However, sometimes while doing this, you would hear foot steps approaching, so you quickly jumped down from the stool and, when your mother entered the kitchen, you pretended as if nothing had happened (whistle, whistle innocently). However, your mother knew. How did she know? You forgot to put the lid back on the cookie jar! Oh, no!\n\nGrowing older (and still not able to resist your mother's cookies), you deviced a contraption that would automatically put the lid back on the cookie jar, _no matter what would happen_.\n\nThe class `CookieJar` is provided: \n```Python\nclass CookieJar(object):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._is_open = False\n\n    def take(self):\n        if not self._is_open:\n            raise ValueError(\"Cookie jar is closed\")\n        return \"Cookie\"\n\n    def open_jar(self):\n        self._is_open = True\n\n    def close_jar(self):\n        self._is_open = False\n\n    def is_open(self):\n        return self._is_open\n```\nYour task is to implement the 'contraption' `SelfClosing` (class, method, whatever; it's your choice) such that, given an instance`cookie_jar` of `CookieJar`, you may call:\n\n```Python\nwith SelfClosing(cookie_jar) as jar:\n    cookie = jar.take()\n```\nafter which, `cookie_jar.is_open() == False`, _no matter what_.\n\nDo not alter the provided code. (Tests will be performed with a code that differs slightly from the one provided, so modifying it is to no avail.)\n\nEnjoy!\ndef __init__(self, jar):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
