rule that you leave at least one urinal free\nbetween you and the next person peeing. \nFor example if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will choose the\nurinal on the right and not the one in the middle.\nThat means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the same time on public toilets with \n5 urinals when following this rule (Only 2 if the first person pees into urinal 2 or 4).\n\n![Imgur Urinals](https://i.imgur.com/imZE6xm.png)\n\n## Your task:\nYou need to write a function that returns the maximum of free urinals as an integer according to the unwritten rule.\n\n### Input\nA String containing 1s and 0s (Example: `10001`) (1 <= Length <= 20)  \nA one stands for a taken urinal and a zero for a free one. \n\n### Examples\n\n`10001` returns 1 (10101)  \n`1001` returns 0 (1001)  \n`00000` returns 3 (10101)  \n`0000` returns 2 (1001)  \n`01000` returns 1 (01010 or 01001) \n\n### Note\nWhen there is already a mistake in the input string (for example `011`), then return `-1`\n\nHave fun and don't pee into the wrong urinal ;)\ndef get_free_urinals(urinals):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
