Every time there is a push to production it requires 500 hands-on deck, a massive manual process, and the fire department is on stand-by along with Fire Marshall Bill the king of manual configuration management. He is called a Fire Marshall because production pushes often burst into flames and rollbacks are a hazard.\n\nThe business demands change and as such has hired a new leader who wants to convert it all to DevOps\u2026..there is a new Sheriff in town.\n\nThe Sheriff's first order of business is to build a DevOps team. He likes Microservices, Cloud, Open-Source, and wants to push to production 9500 times per day without even pressing a button, beautiful seamless immutable infrastructure properly baked in the Continuous Delivery oven is the goal.\n\nThe only problem is Homie the Clown along with Legacy Pete are grandfathered in and union, they started out in the era of green screens and punch cards and are set in their ways. They are not paid by an outcome but instead are measured by the amount of infrastructure under management and total staff headcount.\n\nThe Sheriff has hired a new team of DevOps Engineers. They advocate Open Source, Cloud, and never doing a manual task more than one time. They believe Operations to be a first class citizen with Development and are preparing to shake things up within the company. \n\nSince Legacy is not going away, yet, the Sheriff's job is to get everyone to cooperate so DevOps and the Cloud will be standard. The New Kids on the Block have just started work and are looking to build common services with Legacy Pete and Homie the Clown. \n```\nEvery Time the NKOTB propose a DevOps pattern\u2026\u2026 \n\nHomie stands up and says \"Homie don't Play that!\"\n\nIE: \n\nNKOTB Say -> \"We need Cloud now!\"\n\nHomie Say -> \"Cloud! Homie dont play that!\"\n\nNKOTB Say -> \"We need Automation now!\"\n\nHomie Say -> \"Automation! Homie dont play that!\"\n\nNKOTB Say -> \"We need Microservices now!\"\n\nHomie Say -> \"Microservices! Homie dont play that!\"\n\n```\n\nTask \n\nYou will receive a two-dimensional array with strings made of the NKOTB\u2019s requirements. Each Array contains a domain of DevOps patterns that each of the 5 NKOTB are asking for.\n\nThe requirements array will ALWAYS have five sub-arrays structured like this:\n```\nrequirements[0] = monitoring\nrequirements[1] = automation\nrequirements[2] = deployment\nrequirements[3] = cloud\nrequirements[4] = microservices\n\nEach sub-array will always contain strings in the same format\n\nThe strings will always be in the following format(case insensitive):\n\n\"We need Microservices now!\"\n\nYour job is to create the response from Homie the Clown following the pattern above. \n\nThen return the responses in an array.\n\n\"Microservices! Homie dont play that!\"\n```\nThe first word of the response is always Capitalized and all other letters are lowercase regardless of how you recieve them, the rest of the sentence is always in the format ``` Homie dont play that!```. Strings should be returned in the same order.\n```\nIn addition to the responses create a count of each domain and return it as the last element of the return array in the following format.\n\n'6 monitoring objections, 4 automation, 6 deployment pipeline, 6 cloud, and 3 microservices.'\n\n```\nFor more information on Homie the Clown.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QhuBIkPXn0\n\nFire Marshall Bill on Vacation!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIIsCB4Y8sw#t=202.002651\ndef nkotb_vs_homie(requirements):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
