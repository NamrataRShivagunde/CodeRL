Let fn(0) = 0.\n\nBe An the point of Cn where the tangent to Cn is horizontal and Bn+1 the orthogonal projection of An on the x-axis (it means that An and Bn+1 have the same x -coordinate). \nKn is the intersection of Cn with the x-axis. \n\nThe figure shows C0, A0, B1, K0 as C(0), A0, B1, K0. \n\n![alternative text](https://i.imgur.com/Td9aWIJ.png)\n\nThe architect wants to support each arch Cn with a wall of glass filling the **curved** surface An Bn+1 Kn under the curve Cn.\nOn the drawing you can see the surface `A0 B1 K0` in blue.\n\nHe asks if we could calculate the weight of the surface of glass he needs to support all arches C0...Cn where n is a positive integer knowing he can choose glass thickness hence glass weight per square unit of surface.\n\nHe gives us the absolute value of A0 B1 K0 area (in blue); call it `i0` which is approximately `0.14849853757254047` in square units.\n\n## Task\nWrite the function `weight` with parameters `n` and `w` where `n` is the number of arches to consider (n >= 1) and `w` is the weight of a square unit of glass depending on the wall thickness. \n\nThis function should return the weight of n glass walls as described above.\n\n## Example\n```\nweight(10, 700) -> 120.21882500408238\nweight(8, 1108) -> 190.28922301858418\n```\n## Hint:\nThere is no integral to calculate. You can plot C1 and try to see the relationship between the different Cn and then use `i0`.\n\n## Note: \n- don't round or truncate your result\ndef weight(n, w):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
