In each round player rolls 6 dice. Then (s)he composes combinations from them. Each combination gives certain points. \n\nThen player can take one or more dice combinations to his hand and re-roll remaining dice or save his score. Dice in player's hand won't be taken into account in subsequent rolls.\n\nIf no combinations can be composed - situation is called \"zonk\". Player thrown zonk loses all points in this round and next player moves. So it's player decision when to reroll and when to stop and save his score.\n\nYour task is simple - just evaluate current roll and return maximum number of points can be scored from it. If no combinations can be made - function must return string ``\"Zonk\"`` (without quotes).\n\nThere are different variations of Zonk. In this kata, we will use most common table of combinations:\n\nCombinationExample rollPoints\nStraight (1,2,3,4,5 and 6)6 3 1 2 5 41000 points\nThree pairs of any dice2 2 4 4 1 1750 points\nThree of 11 4 1 11000 points\nThree of 22 3 4 2 2200 points\nThree of 33 4 3 6 3 2300 points\nThree of 44 4 4400 points\nThree of 52 5 5 5 4500 points\nThree of 66 6 2 6600 points\nFour of a kind1 1 1 1 4 62 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 2000 pts)\nFive of a kind5 5 5 4 5 53 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1500 pts)\nSix of a kind4 4 4 4 4 44 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1600 pts)\nEvery 14 3 1 2 2100 points\nEvery 55 2 650 points\n\n\nEach die cannot be used in multiple combinations the same time, so three pairs of 2, 3 and 5 will worth you only ``750`` points (for three pairs), not 850 (for three pairs and two fives). But you can select multiple combinations, ``2 2 2 1 6`` will worth you ``300`` points (200 for three-of-kind '2' plus 100 for single '1' die)\n\nExamples:\n```python\n  get_score([1,2,3]) # returns 100 = points from one 1\n  get_score([3,4,1,1,5]) # returns 250 = points from two 1 and one 5\n  get_score([2,3,2,3,3,2]) # returns 500 = three of 2 + three of 3\n  get_score([1,1,1,1,1,5]) # returns 3050 = five 1 + one 5\n  get_score([2,3,4,3,6,6]) # returns \"Zonk\" = no combinations here\n  get_score([2,2,6,6,2,2]) # returns 400 = four 2, this cannot be scored as three pairs\n  get_score([1,3,4,3,4,1]) # returns 750 = three pairs\n  get_score([3,3,3,3]) # returns 600 = four of 3\n  get_score([1,2,3,4,5]) # returns 150 = it's not straight\n```\nOf course, in real Zonk game it's sometimes not worth to collect all combination from roll. Taking less dice and rerolling more remaining may be better, but task is just to calculate maximum possible score from current single roll.\n\nP.S.
