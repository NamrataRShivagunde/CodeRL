The first one consists of keys, the second one consists of values. Write a function ```createDict(keys, values)``` that returns a dictionary created from keys and values. If there are not enough values, the rest of keys should have a ```None``` value. If there not enough keys, just ignore the rest of values.\n\nExample 1:\n```python\nkeys = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\nvalues = [1, 2, 3]\ncreateDict(keys, values) # returns {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': None}\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```python\nkeys = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nvalues = [1, 2, 3, 4]\ncreateDict(keys, values) # returns {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n```\ndef createDict(keys, values):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
