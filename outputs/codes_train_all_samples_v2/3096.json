k will always be >=1.\n\nFor example, with n=7 and k=3 `josephus(7,3)` should act this way.\n```\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] - initial sequence\n[1,2,4,5,6,7] => 3 is counted out and goes into the result [3]\n[1,2,4,5,7] => 6 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6]\n[1,4,5,7] => 2 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2]\n[1,4,5] => 7 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2,7]\n[1,4] => 5 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2,7,5]\n[4] => 1 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2,7,5,1]\n[] => 4 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2,7,5,1,4]\n```\nSo our final result is:\n```\njosephus([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],3)==[3,6,2,7,5,1,4]\n```\nFor more info, browse the Josephus Permutation page on wikipedia;
