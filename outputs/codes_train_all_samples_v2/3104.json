In order to let his reindeers rest a bit, he only takes as many reindeers with him as he is required to do. The others may take a nap.\n\nTwo reindeers are always required for the sleigh and Santa himself. Additionally he needs 1 reindeer per 30 presents. As you know, Santa has 8 reindeers in total, so he can deliver up to 180 presents at once (2 reindeers for Santa and the sleigh + 6 reindeers with 30 presents each).\n\nComplete the function `reindeers()`, which takes a number of presents and returns the minimum numbers of required reindeers. If the number of presents is too high, throw an error.\n\nExamles:\n\n```python\nreindeer(0) # must return 2\nreindeer(1) # must return 3\nreindeer(30) # must return 3\nreindeer(200) # must throw an error\n```\ndef reindeer(presents):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
