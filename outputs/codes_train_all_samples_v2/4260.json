You've won the temples games and now you're hunting for treasure in the final temple run. There's good news and bad news. You've found the treasure but you've triggered a nasty trap. You'll surely perish in the temple chamber.\n\nWith your last movements, you've decided to draw an \"X\" marks the spot for the next archeologist.\n\nGiven an odd number, n, draw an X for the next crew. Follow the example below.\n\n`\n`\nIf n = 1 return 'X\\n' and if you're given an even number or invalid input, return '?'.\n\nThe output should be a string with no spaces after the final X on each line, but a \\n to indicate a new line.\n\n\nCheck out my other 80's Kids Katas:\n\n\n80's Kids #1: How Many Licks Does It Take\n80's Kids #2: Help Alf Find His Spaceship\n80's Kids #3: Punky Brewster's Socks\n80's Kids #4: Legends of the Hidden Temple\n80's Kids #5: You Can't Do That on Television\n80's Kids #6: Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em Robots\n80's Kids #7: She's a Small Wonder\n80's Kids #8: The Secret World of Alex Mack\n80's Kids #9: Down in Fraggle Rock \n80's Kids #10: Captain Planet\ndef mark_spot(n):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
