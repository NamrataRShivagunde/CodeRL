skill level is greater than or equal to the value of the pose.\n\n Task\n\nYour task is to return the total amount poses completed for the entire ```classroom```.\n\nExample\n\n```\nclassroom = [\n            [1,1,0,1], #sum = 3\n            [2,0,6,0], #sum = 8\n            [0,2,2,0], #sum = 4\n            ]\n                    \nposes = [4, 0, 20, 10]\n\n3 people in row 1 can complete the first pose\nEverybody in row 1 can complete the second pose\nNobody in row 1 can complete the third pose\nNobody in row 1 can complete the fourth pose\n\nThe total poses completed for row 1 is 7\n\nYou'll
