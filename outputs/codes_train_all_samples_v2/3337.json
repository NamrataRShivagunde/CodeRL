However, it is not due to basketball. You need to extract statements within strings that are contained within brackets.\n\nYou have to write a function that returns a list of statements that are contained within brackets given a string. If the value entered in the function is not a string, well, you know where that variable should be sitting.\n\nGood luck!\ndef bracket_buster(string):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
