One day (as I was plying him with questions) he said:\n\n* \"Imagine I have between `m` and `n` Zloty...\" (or did he say Quetzal? I can't remember!)\n* \"If I were to buy **9** cars costing `c` each, I'd only have 1 Zloty (or was it Meticals?) left.\"\n* \"And if I were to buy **7** boats at `b` each, I'd only have 2 Ringglets (or was it Zloty?) left.\"\n\nCould you tell me in each possible case:\n\n1. how much money `f` he could possibly have ?\n2. the cost `c` of a car?\n3. the cost `b` of a boat?\n\nSo, I will have a better idea about his fortune. Note that if `m-n` is big enough, you might have a lot of possible answers. \n\nEach answer should be given as `[\"M: f\", \"B: b\", \"C: c\"]` and all the answers as `[ [\"M: f\", \"B: b\", \"C: c\"], ... ]`. \"M\" stands for money, \"B\" for boats, \"C\" for cars.\n\n**Note:** `m, n, f, b, c` are positive integers, where `0 <= m <= n` or `m >= n >= 0`. `m` and `n` are inclusive.\n\n\n## Examples:\n```\nhowmuch(1, 100)      => [[\"M: 37\", \"B: 5\", \"C: 4\"], [\"M: 100\", \"B: 14\", \"C: 11\"]]\nhowmuch(1000, 1100)  => [[\"M: 1045\", \"B: 149\", \"C: 116\"]]\nhowmuch(10000, 9950) => [[\"M: 9991\", \"B: 1427\", \"C: 1110\"]]\nhowmuch(0, 200)      => [[\"M: 37\", \"B: 5\", \"C: 4\"], [\"M: 100\", \"B: 14\", \"C: 11\"], [\"M: 163\", \"B: 23\", \"C: 18\"]]\n```\n\nExplanation of the results for `howmuch(1, 100)`:\n\n* In the first answer his possible fortune is **37**:\n * so he can buy 7 boats each worth 5: `37 - 7 * 5 = 2`\n * or he can buy 9 cars worth 4 each: `37 - 9 * 4 = 1`\n* The second possible answer is **100**:\n * he can buy 7 boats each worth 14: `100 - 7 * 14 = 2`\n * or he can buy 9 cars worth 11: `100 - 9 * 11 = 1`\n\n# Note\nSee \"Sample Tests\" to know the format of the return.\ndef howmuch(m, n):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
