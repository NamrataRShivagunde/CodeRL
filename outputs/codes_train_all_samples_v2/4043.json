He can get some bonuses.\n\nHe needs to play a game to determine the amount of his bonus.\n\nHere are `n` rows and `m` columns of cards were placed on the ground. A non-negative number is written on each card.\n\nThe rules of the game are:\n\n- Player starts from the top-left coner, walk to the bottom-right coner. \n\n- Players can only walk downward or right. \n\n- The sum of the numbers collected by the players will be used as the bonus.\n\nJohn has two chances to play this game on a game map. Specifically, when John finishes the game, the card on his path will be removed, and then he can walk again.\n\nYour task is to help John calculate the maximum amount of bonuses he can get.\n\n# Input\n\n- `gameMap/gamemap`: A `n` x `m` integer array. Each element represents the number on the card.\n  - `4 <= n,m <= 40(Pyhon)/100(JS)`\n\n\n- All inputs are valid.\n\n# Output\n\nAn integer. the maximum amount of bonuses John can get.\n\n# Eaxmple\n\nFor \n```\ngameMap=\n[\n[1, 3, 9],\n[2, 8, 5],\n[5, 7, 4]\n]\n```\nThe output should be `39`.\n\nOne of the possible solution is:\n```\n1st game:\n[\n[>, >, v],\n[2, 8, v],\n[5, 7, v]\n]\n1+3+9+5+4=22\n\n2nd game:\n[\n[v, 0, 0],\n[>, v, 0],\n[5, >, >]\n]\n0+2+8+7+0=17\n\nFinal bonus = 22 + 17 = 39\n```\ndef calc(gamemap):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
