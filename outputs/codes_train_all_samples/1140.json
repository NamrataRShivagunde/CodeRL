Similarly $power(x,y)$ returns $x^y$.\nLet $a$ be the array $a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3, \\ldots,a_n$ where $a_j = j$ for each index $j$ and the last index $n = (2^p-1)$ for a fixed integer parameter $p$.  Given an integer $p$ and an index $idx$, your task is calculate the element at index $idx$ in the array returned by executing $order(a, 0)$.\nFor example, suppose $ p = 3$ and $idx = 3$.\n- The initial array is $a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$.\n- Executing $order(a, 0)$ first creates two new arrays $l == [0, 2, 4, 6]$ and $r == [1, 3, 5, 7]$.\n- Next, $order(l, 1)$ and $order(r, 1)$ are executed.\n- $order(l, 1)$, in turn, executes $order([0, 4], 2)$ and $order([2, 6], 2)$ which return $[0, 4]$ and $[2, 6]$, respectively. These are then concatenated, so $order(l, 1)$ returns $[0, 4, 2, 6]$.\n- Similarly, $order(r, 1)$ returns $[1, 5, 3, 7]$.\n- These two are concatenated as the final result, so the array returned by $order(a, 0)$ is $[0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7]$.\nSo, if the input is $p = 3$, and $idx = 3$, the answer is $6$. If $p = 3$ and $idx = 7$, the answer should be $7$.\n\n-----Input Format:-----\n- The first line contains a single integer, $T$, which is the number of testcases. The description of each testcase follows.\n- Each testcase is described by a single line with two integers: $p$ and $idx$, where $p$ is the parameter that determines the length of the array $a$ and $idx$ is the index at which you have to report the value in the output of $order(a, 0)$.\n\n-----Output Format:-----\n- You should print the answer in a new line for each testcase, which should be a single integer, the element at index $idx$ after executing $order(a, 0)$ for the array $a$ defined by the parameter $p$.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$ \n- $1 \\leq p \\leq 50$\n- $0 \\leq idx \\leq 2^p-1$\n\n-----SUBTASKS:-----\n- Subtask 1: 20% points : $1 \\leq p \\leq 20$\n- Subtask 2: 80% points: Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n3 3\n3 7\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n6\n7\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nBoth the testcases have been explained in the problem statement.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
