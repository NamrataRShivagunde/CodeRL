book:It is reminiscent of the Fibonacci definition in that each new value is a sum of two\nprevious values-but not of the immediately previous two values. Instead, the two\nimmediately previous values tell how far to count back to obtain the numbers to be added\nto make the new value.\nThe function produces the starting sequence:  \n`1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6 . . .`  \nTest info: 100 random tests, n is always positive\nGood luck!\ndef hofstadter_Q(n):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
