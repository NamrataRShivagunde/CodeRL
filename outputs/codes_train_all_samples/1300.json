She needs your help and wants you complete the task.\nYou are given a list of integers and two values $N$ and $K$ $-$ the size of array of integers and the numbers of partitions to be made respectively.\nYou have to partition the list of integers without changing the order of elements ,into exactly $K$ parts. \nCalculate Greatest Common Divisor of all $K$ partition and sum up the gcd values for each partition.\nMaximize the sum obtained. \nCan you help Sunita ? \n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \n- Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. \n- Next line contains $N$ integers $-$ the list of integers.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, output in a single line integer $-$ the maximal result.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq N, K \\leq 250$\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq N$\n- $1 \\leq A[i] \\leq 1e5$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n4 2\n5 6 3 2\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n6\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\n[5] [6 3 2] is the best partition [5 + GCD(6,3,2)] = 6\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
