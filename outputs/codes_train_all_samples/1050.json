\nShe knows that one of the most important components of a compiler, is its parser.\nA parser is, in simple terms, a software component that processes text, and checks it's semantic correctness, or, if you prefer, if the text is properly built.\nAs an example, in declaring and initializing an integer, in C/C++, you can't do something like:\nint = x ;4\nas the semantics of such statement is incorrect, as we all know that the datatype must precede an identifier and only afterwards should come the equal sign and the initialization value, so, the corrected statement should be:\nint x = 4;\nToday, Lira is concerned with an abstract instruction which is composed of the characters \"<\" and \">\" , which she will use on the design of her language, L++ :D.\nShe is using it as an abstraction for generating XML code Tags in an easier fashion and she understood that, for an expression to be valid, a \"<\" symbol must always have a corresponding \">\" character somewhere (not necessary immediately) after it. Moreover, each \">\" symbol should correspond to exactly one \"<\" symbol.\nSo, for instance, the instructions:\n<<>> \n<> \n<><> \nare all valid. While:\n>> \n><>< \nare not.\nGiven some expressions which represent some instructions to be analyzed by Lira's compiler, you should tell the length of the longest prefix of each of these expressions that is valid, or 0 if there's no such a prefix.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput will consist of an integer T denoting the number of test cases to follow.\nThen, T strings follow, each on a single line, representing a possible expression in L++.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each expression you should output the length of the longest prefix that is valid or 0 if there's no such a prefix. \n\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 500\n- 1 \u2264 The length of a single expression \u2264 106\n- The total size all the input expressions is no more than 5*106\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n3\n<<>>\n><\n<>>>\nOutput:\n4\n0\n2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
