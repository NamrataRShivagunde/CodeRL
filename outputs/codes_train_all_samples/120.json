The function $f(s)$ is equal to the number of substrings in the string $s$ that contains at least one symbol, that is equal to \"1\".\n\nMore formally, $f(s)$ is equal to the number of pairs of integers $(l, r)$, such that $1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq |s|$ (where $|s|$ is equal to the length of string $s$), such that at least one of the symbols $s_l, s_{l+1}, \\ldots, s_r$ is equal to \"1\". \n\nFor example, if $s = $\"01010\" then $f(s) = 12$, because there are $12$ such pairs $(l, r)$: $(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5)$.\n\nAyoub also thinks that he is smarter than Mahmoud so he gave him two integers $n$ and $m$ and asked him this problem. For all binary strings $s$ of length $n$ which contains exactly $m$ symbols equal to \"1\", find the maximum value of $f(s)$.\n\nMahmoud couldn't solve the problem so he asked you for help. Can you help him? \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line for each test case contains two integers $n$, $m$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$, $0 \\leq m \\leq n$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the string and the number of symbols equal to \"1\" in it.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor every test case print one integer number\u00a0\u2014 the maximum value of $f(s)$ over all strings $s$ of length $n$, which has exactly $m$ symbols, equal to \"1\".\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n3 1\n3 2\n3 3\n4 0\n5 2\n\nOutput\n4\n5\n6\n0\n12\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, there exists only $3$ strings of length $3$, which has exactly $1$ symbol, equal to \"1\". These strings are: $s_1 = $\"100\", $s_2 = $\"010\", $s_3 = $\"001\". The values of $f$ for them are: $f(s_1) = 3, f(s_2) = 4, f(s_3) = 3$, so the maximum value is $4$ and the answer is $4$.\n\nIn the second test case, the string $s$ with the maximum value is \"101\".\n\nIn the third test case, the string $s$ with the maximum value is \"111\".\n\nIn the fourth test case, the only string $s$ of length $4$, which has exactly $0$ symbols, equal to \"1\" is \"0000\" and the value of $f$ for that string is $0$, so the answer is $0$.\n\nIn the fifth test case, the string $s$ with the maximum value is \"01010\" and it is described as an example in the problem statement.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
