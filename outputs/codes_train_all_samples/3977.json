Cluster analysis is employed in many fields such as machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, etc.\n\nIn this kata, your task is to implement a simple clustering technique called 'Unweighted pair-group average'. This method takes a set of 2D points and the desired number of final clusters. Initially, each point forms its own cluster. The most similar (least distant) clusters are iteratively merged until the target number of clusters is reached.\n\nThe distance metric between two clusters is defined as the average distance between all pairs of points from the two clusters. For example: \n```\nCluster 1: (0, 0), (0, 1)\nCluster 2: (4, 3)\nDistance = (sqrt((0-4)^2 + (0-3)^2) + sqrt((0-4)^2 + (1-2)^2)) / 2\n```\n\nInput:\n- ```points``` - a list of 2D points ```[(1, 1), (3, 5), (4, 4), (8, 2), (0, 1)]```\n- ```n``` - the desired number of clusters\n\nOutput:\n- list of clusters, each cluster is a list of points\n- points in each cluster should be sorted in ascending order\n- the list of clusters should also be sorted in ascending order\n\nExample:\n- ```cluster(3, [(1, 1), (3, 5), (4, 4), (8, 2), (0, 1)])```\n- should return \n```[ [(0, 1), (1, 1)],\n     [(3, 5), (4, 4)],\n     [(8, 2)]\n   ]\n```\n   \nNotes:\n- the coordinates ```(x, y)``` are chosen from interval ```<0, 1000>```\n- ```0 < len(points) <= 100```\n- ```0 < n <= len(points)```\n- there is always only one unique solution\n- there are no duplicate points in the input\ndef cluster(points, n):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
