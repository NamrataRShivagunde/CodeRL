As usual, the rules of this game are extremely strange and uncommon.\nFirst, they are given a stack of $N$ discs. Each disc has a distinct, non-negative integer written on it. The players exchange turns to make a move. Before the start of the game, they both agree upon a set of positive integers  $S$ of size $K$. It is guaranteed that S contains the integer $1$. In a move, a player can select any value $x$ from $S$ and pop exactly $x$ elements from the top of the stack. The game ends when there are no discs remaining. Chef goes first.\nScoring: For every disc a player pops, his score increases by $2^p$ where $p$ is the integer written on the disc. For example, if a player pops the discs, with integers $p_1, p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_m$ written on it, during the entire course of the game, then his total score will be $2^{p_1} + 2^{p_2} + 2^{p_3} + \\dots + 2^{p_m}$.\nThe player with higher score wins the game. Determine the winner if both the players play optimally, or if the game ends in a draw.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line contains $T$, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\n- The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers $N$ and $K$, denoting the size of the stack and the set S respectively.\n- Next line contains $N$ space separated integers $A_i$ where $A_1$ is the topmost element, denoting the initial arrangement of the stack.\n- The last line of each test case contains $K$ space separated integers each denoting $x_i$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase, output \"Chef\" (without quotes) if Chef wins, \"Garry\" (without quotes) if Garry wins, otherwise \"Draw\" (without quotes) in a separate line.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq \\min(100, N)$\n- $0 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9$\n- $1 \\leq x_i \\leq N$\n- $x_i \\neq x_j$ for all $i \\neq j$\n- $A_i \\neq A_j$ for all $i \\neq j$\n- Set $S$ contains integer $1$. \n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n3 2\n5 7 1\n1 2\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\nChef\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nChef can select 2 from the set and draw the top two discs (with integers 5 and 7 written on it) from the stack. Garry cannot select 2 from the set as there is only 1 disc left in the stack. However, he can select 1 from the set and pop the last disc.\nSo, Chef's score = $2^5$ + $2^7$ = $160$\n\nGarry's score = $2^1$ = $2$\n\nChef wins.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
