There they bought a pizza. Chef divided the pizza into K equal slices. Now you have to check whether these K pizza slices can be distributed equally among the friends. Also given that every person should get at least one slice. If the above conditions are possible then print \"YES\" otherwise print \"NO\".\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a integers N.\nThe second line of each test case contains K.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing \"YES\" if the given conditions are true else \"NO\" if the given conditions are false.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n1<=T<=10\n1<=N<=10^6\n1<=K<=10^6\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n10\n20\n12\n5\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\nYES\nNO\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nExplanation case 1: since there are 10 friends and 20 pizza slice, so each can get 2 slices, so \"YES\".\nExplanation case 2: Since there are 12 friends and only 5 pizza slice, so there is no way pizza slices can be distributed equally and each friend gets at least one pizza slice, so \"NO\".\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
