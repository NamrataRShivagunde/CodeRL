quarterbacks.\nI knew a rating of 100 is pretty good, but never knew what makes up the rating.\nSo out of curiosity I took a look at the wikipedia page and had an idea or my first kata: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating\n\n## Formula\n\nThere are four parts to the NFL formula:\n```python\nA = ((Completions / Attempts) - .3) * 5\nB = ((Yards / Attempts) - 3) * .25\nC = (Touchdowns / Attempt) * 20\nD = 2.375 - ((Interceptions / Attempts) * 25)\n```\nHowever, if the result of any calculation is greater than `2.375`, it is set to `2.375`. If the result is a negative number, it is set to zero.\n\nFinally the passer rating is: `((A + B + C + D) / 6) * 100`\n\nReturn the rating rounded to the nearest tenth.\n\n## Example\n\nLast year Tom Brady had 432 attempts, 3554 yards, 291 completions, 28 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions.\nHis passer rating was 112.2\n\nHappy coding!\ndef passer_rating(att, yds, comp, td, ints):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
