same non-zero length.\nWe are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].\u00a0 Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.\nAt the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing.\u00a0 (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1].)\nGiven A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.\u00a0 It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.\nExample:\nInput: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nSwap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:\nA = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nwhich are both strictly increasing.\n\nNote:\n\nA, B are arrays with the same length, and that length will be in the range [1, 1000].\nA[i], B[i] are integer values in the range [0, 2000].\nclass Solution:\n    def minSwap(self, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> int:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
