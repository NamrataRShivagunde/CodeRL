Several simplifications and rules apply, which may not hold in real life: \n\n- Strings are case sensitive, but there are no tests playing around with \"Peter\", \"PETER\" and \"PeTeR\".\n- People are uniquely identified by their name. For instance, there are no two different people called \"Jim\" in the same family.\n- Once a person has an assigned gender, it cannot be changed.\n- No gender conclusions should be made from personal names: \"Bob\" could well be a woman and \"Susan\" a man.\n- People cannot have more than one mother and one father.\n- The terms \"parents\" and \"children\" refer to the relatives in the immediate previous/next generations only, not to more remote ancestors or descendants.\n- Incest may occur, so, for example, one's parent may at the same time be their grandparent.\n- One cannot be their own ancestor.\n- Age is not accounted for. Even if some incestuous relationships would infer that one's parent is more than 5 generations older, it should be allowed.\n- In case a name's first occurrence is in a call of one of the two gender querying methods, the return value will always be false, as that new person does not have a known gender.\n- In case a name's first occurrence is in a call of one of the two relation querying methods, the return value will always be an empty array/list, as there are no relationships known yet in which that new person participates.\n- For the reasons in the preceding two bullet points it should not matter whether you actually store that name in these cases in your data structure, or not. In the latter case you would only store it at the next occasion when that name is mentioned in a call of one of the three other methods, that actually *add* information. The described interface has no way to query the difference between these two possible implementations, so you can choose freely.\n\n# Example\n\nConsider the following family graph:\n\n\n  .dot { height: 49px; width: 100px; background-color: #666; border-radius: 50%;\n      border: #aaa 1px solid ; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; }\n  table.tight { border-spacing: 0px; border-collapse: separate; width: 250px}\n  table.tight td { padding: 0px; min-width: 25px; height: 25px; }\n  .up { border-top: #aaa 1px solid; }\n  .right { border-right: #aaa 1px solid; }\n  .red { color: #ea6 }\n\n\n\nDylan (m)\n\nMorgan\u00a0(f)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrank (m)\n\nJuly\n\nJennifer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy\n\n\n\n\nIt could be created step by step with the following code \u2014 the expected return value for each method call is indicated in comments:\n\n```python\nfam = Family()\nfam.set_parent_of(\"Frank\", \"Morgan\")       # True\nfam.set_parent_of(\"Frank\", \"Dylan\")        # True\nfam.male(\"Dylan\")                          # True\nfam.male(\"Dylan\")                          # True, no conflict\nfam.set_parent_of(\"Joy\", \"Frank\")          # True\nfam.male(\"Frank\")                          # True\nfam.male(\"Morgan\")                         # False\n# (Morgan is a woman because she both is Frank's parent, but not his father) \nfam.set_parent_of(\"July\", \"Morgan\")        # True\n# (The preceding assertion was rejected, so there is no conflict)\nfam.is_male(\"Joy\") or fam.is_female(\"Joy\") # False\n# (We know Joy is Frank's child, but we can't derive Joy's gender)\nfam.get_children_of(\"Morgan\")              # [\"Frank\", \"July\"]\nfam.set_parent_of(\"Jennifer\", \"Morgan\")    # True\nfam.get_children_of(\"Morgan\")              # [\"Frank\", \"Jennifer\", \"July\"]\nfam.get_children_of(\"Dylan\")               # [\"Frank\"]\n# (That is all we know for sure)\nfam.get_parents_of(\"Frank\")                # [\"Dylan\", \"Morgan\"]\nfam.set_parent_of(\"Morgan\", \"Frank\")       # False\n# (It is impossible to be the parent of your parent)\n```\n\nHave fun!\ndef __init__(self):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
