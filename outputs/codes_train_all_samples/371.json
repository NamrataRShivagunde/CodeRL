Each routes[i] is a bus route that the i-th bus\u00a0repeats forever. For example if routes[0] = [1, 5, 7], this means that the first\u00a0bus (0-th indexed) travels in the sequence 1->5->7->1->5->7->1->... forever.\nWe start at bus stop S (initially not on a bus), and we want to go to bus stop T. Travelling by buses only, what is the least number of buses we must take to reach our destination? Return -1 if it is not possible.\nExample:\nInput: \nroutes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]]\nS = 1\nT = 6\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nThe best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= routes.length <= 500.\n1 <= routes[i].length <= 10^5.\n0 <= routes[i][j] < 10 ^ 6.\nclass Solution:\n    def numBusesToDestination(self, routes: List[List[int]], S: int, T: int) -> int:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
