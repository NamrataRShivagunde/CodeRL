To amuse himself, he decides to play the following game : he draws a sequence of N squares on the ground, numbered 1 to N, and writes an integer in each square. He starts at square k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 N). The game consists of one forward phase followed by one backward phase.\n- In the forward phase, Calvin makes zero or more moves of the following type : if his current position is p, he can jump to p+1 or p+2 as long as he stays within the N squares.\n- In the backward phase, Calvin makes zero or more moves of the following type : if his current position is p, he can jump to p\u22121 or p\u22122 as long as he stays within the N squares.\nHe plays such that he finally ends up at square 1, and then he stops. He starts with a score of 0, and each time he jumps from square i to square j, he adds the integer written in square j to his score. Find the maximum score Calvin can obtain by playing this game. Recall that Calvin must start at square k and end at square 1. The integer on the square where he starts is not included in his score.\nFor example, suppose N = 5 and the numbers in squares are 5, 3, \u22122, 1, 1. If k = 2, Calvin starts on the second square. He can make a forward move to square 4, another to square 5, a backward move to square 4, another to square 2, and another to square 1. His total score is 1+1+1+3+5 = 11. You can check that this is the maximum score possible.\n\n-----Input format-----\n\u2022 Line 1 : Two space-separated integers, N and k, with 1 \u2264 k \u2264 N.\n\u2022 Line 2 : A space-separated sequence of N integers, the numbers in squares 1, 2 . . . , N .\n\n-----Output format-----\nA single line with a single integer, the maximum score Calvin can obtain by playing the game.\n\n-----Test Data-----\nThe testdata is grouped into two subtasks with the following constraints on the inputs.\n\u2022 Subtask 1 [30 points] : 1 \u2264 N \u2264 3000.\n\u2022 Subtask 2 [70 points] : 1 \u2264 N \u2264 106.\nIn all subtasks, the number in each square is between \u22121000 and 1000 inclusive.\n\n-----Example-----\nHere is the sample input and output corresponding to the example above.\n\n-----Sample input-----\n5 2\n5 3 -2 1 1\n\n-----Sample output-----\n11\n\nNote: Your program should not print anything other than what is specified in the output format.
