If you didn't do it yet, you should begin there.\n\n---\n\nThe Ulam sequence U is defined by `u0=u`, `u1=v`, with the general term `u_n` for `n>2` given by the least integer expressible uniquely as the sum of two distinct earlier terms.  \nIn other words, the next number is always the smallest, unique sum of any two previous terms.\n\nThe first 10 terms of the sequence `U(u0=1, u1=2)` are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18]`.\n\n* Here, the first term after the initial `1, 2` is obviously `3` since `3=1+2`.\n* The next term is `4=1+3` (we don't have to worry about `4=2+2` since it is a sum of a single term instead of two distinct terms)\n* `5` is not a member of the sequence since it is representable in two ways: `5=1+4=2+3`, but `6=2+4` is a member (since `3+3` isn't a valid calculation).\n\nYou'll have to write a code that creates an Ulam Sequence starting with `u0`, `u1` and containing `n` terms.\n\n---\n\n# ___The pitfall...___\n\nWhile the passing solutions of the first version could have a time complexity of O(N^(3)) (or even O(N^(4))!!), with 20 tests up to 100 terms only, here you'll have to manage generation of sequences up to 1500 terms before time out.\n\n___Inputs:___\n\n* `u0` and `u1`: integers, greater than or equal to 1\n* `n`: integer greater than 1, length of the returned list\n\n___Configuration of the tests:___\n\n```if:python\n* 6 small fixed tests\n* 20 random tests on small sequences (10 to 30 terms)\n* 13 large random tests (1500 terms)\n```\n```if:ruby\n* 6 small fixed tests\n* 20 random tests on small sequences (10 to 30 terms)\n* 16 large random tests (1500 terms)\n```\n```if:javascript,go\n* 6 small fixed tests\n* 40 random tests on small sequences (10 to 30 terms)\n* 30 large random tests (2450 terms)\n```\n\n---\n\nDescription Reference: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/UlamSequence.html\ndef ulam_sequence(u0, u1, n):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
