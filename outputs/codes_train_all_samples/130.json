The program forgot to print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits and all we know is that all integers in the array were in the range\u00a0[1, k]\u00a0and there are no leading zeros in the array.\nGiven the string s and the integer k. There can be multiple ways to restore the array.\nReturn the number of possible array that can be printed as a string s\u00a0using the mentioned program.\nThe number of ways could be very large so return it modulo 10^9 + 7\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"1000\", k = 10000\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The only possible array is [1000]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"1000\", k = 10\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There cannot be an array that was printed this way and has all integer >= 1 and <= 10.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = \"1317\", k = 2000\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: Possible arrays are [1317],[131,7],[13,17],[1,317],[13,1,7],[1,31,7],[1,3,17],[1,3,1,7]\n\nExample 4:\nInput: s = \"2020\", k = 30\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The only possible array is [20,20]. [2020] is invalid because 2020 > 30. [2,020] is ivalid because 020 contains leading zeros.\n\nExample 5:\nInput: s = \"1234567890\", k = 90\nOutput: 34\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 10^5.\ns consists of only digits and doesn't contain leading zeros.\n1 <= k <= 10^9.\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfArrays(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
