But the faire will only start if there are archers signed and if they all have enough arrows in their quivers - at least 5 is the requirement! Are all the archers ready?\n\n#Reference\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions\n\n#Argument\n`archers` is an array of integers, in which each element corresponds to the number of arrows each archer has.\n\n#Return\nYour function must return `true` if the requirements are met or `false` otherwise.\n\n#Examples\n`archersReady([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])` returns `false` because there are archers with not enough arrows.\n\n`archersReady([5, 6, 7, 8])` returns `true`.\ndef archers_ready(archers):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
