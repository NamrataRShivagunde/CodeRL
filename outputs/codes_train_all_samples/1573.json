That is, every match has a winner and a loser. \nWith Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  \nYour task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.\n\n-----Output:-----\n- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n- Otherwise print \"YES\" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. \n- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. \n- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.\n- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 100$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- 10 points : $2 \\leq N \\leq 6$\n- 90 points :  Original Constraints. \n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n3\n2\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\nYES\n010\n001\n100\nNO\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nOne such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
