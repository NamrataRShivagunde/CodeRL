"\nQUESTION:\nYour car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line.\u00a0 (Your car can go into negative positions.)\nYour car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions A (accelerate) and R (reverse).\nWhen you get an instruction \"A\", your car does the following:\u00a0position += speed, speed *= 2.\nWhen you get an instruction \"R\", your car does the following: if your speed is positive then\u00a0speed = -1\u00a0, otherwise\u00a0speed = 1.\u00a0 (Your position stays the same.)\nFor example, after commands \"AAR\", your car goes to positions 0->1->3->3, and your speed goes to 1->2->4->-1.\nNow for some target position, say the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.\nExample 1:\nInput: \ntarget = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nThe shortest instruction sequence is \"AA\".\nYour position goes from 0->1->3.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \ntarget = 6\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: \nThe shortest instruction sequence is \"AAARA\".\nYour position goes from 0->1->3->7->7->6.\n\n\u00a0\nNote: \n\n1 <= target <= 10000.\nclass Solution:\n    def racecar(self, target: int) -> int:\n        \nUse Call-Based
