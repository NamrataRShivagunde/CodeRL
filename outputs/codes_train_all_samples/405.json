"\nQUESTION:\nAlice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game \"21\".\nAlice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K points.\u00a0 During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.\u00a0 Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.\nAlice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.\u00a0 What is the probability\u00a0that she has N or less points?\nExample 1:\nInput: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10\nOutput: 1.00000\nExplanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10\nOutput: 0.60000\nExplanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.\nIn 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10\nOutput: 0.73278\nNote:\n\n0 <= K <= N <= 10000\n1 <= W <= 10000\nAnswers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.\nThe judging time limit has been reduced for this question.\nclass Solution:\n    def new21Game(self, N: int, K: int, W: int) -> float:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
