Just a new idea. Now Chef is expanding his business. He wants to make some new restaurants in the big city of Lviv. To make his business competitive he should interest customers. Now he knows how. But don't tell anyone -  it is a secret plan. Chef knows four national Ukrainian dishes - salo, borsch, varenyky and galushky. It is too few, of course, but enough for the beginning. Every day in his restaurant will be a dish of the day among these four ones. And dishes of the consecutive days must be different. To make the scheme more refined the dish of the first day and the dish of the last day must be different too. Now he wants his assistant to make schedule for some period. Chef suspects that there is more than one possible schedule. Hence he wants his assistant to prepare all possible plans so that he can choose the best one among them. He asks you for help. At first tell him how many such schedules exist. Since the answer can be large output it modulo 109 + 7, that is, you need to output the remainder of division of the actual answer by 109 + 7.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contains a single integer N denoting the number of days for which the schedule should be made.\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case output a single integer in a separate line, the answer for the corresponding test case.\n\n-----Constraints-----1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n2 \u2264 N \u2264 109\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n3\n2\n3\n5\n\nOutput:\n12\n24\n240\n\n-----Explanation-----\nCase 1. For N = 2 days we have the following 12 schedules:\nFirst day Second day  salo   borsch    salo   varenyky    salo   galushky    borsch   salo    borsch   varenyky    borsch   galushky    varenyky   salo    varenyky   borsch    varenyky   galushky    galushky   salo    galushky   borsch    galushky   varenyky  \n\nCase 2. For N = 3 we have the following 24 schedules:\nFirst daySecond dayThird day  salo   borsch   varenyky    salo   borsch   galushky    salo   varenyky   borsch    salo   varenyky   galushky    salo   galushky   borsch    salo   galushky   varenyky    borsch   salo   varenyky    borsch   salo   galushky    borsch   varenyky   salo    borsch   varenyky   galushky    borsch   galushky   salo    borsch   galushky   varenyky    varenyky   salo   borsch    varenyky   salo   galushky    varenyky   borsch   salo    varenyky   borsch   galushky    varenyky   galushky   salo    varenyky   galushky   borsch    galushky   salo   borsch    galushky   salo   varenyky    galushky   borsch   salo    galushky   borsch   varenyky    galushky   varenyky   salo    galushky   varenyky   borsch  \n\nCase 3. Don't be afraid. This time we will not provide you with a table of 240 schedules. The only thing we want to mention here is that apart from the previous two cases schedules for other values of N can have equal dishes (and even must have for N > 4). For example the schedule (salo, borsch, salo, borsch) is a correct schedule for N = 4 while the schedule (varenyky, salo, galushky, verynky, salo) is a correct schedule for N = 5.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
