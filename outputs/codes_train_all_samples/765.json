Every day Chef tries to visit as much cities as possible. Recently he had a quite a few trips of great Chefland for learning various recipes. Chefland had N cities numbered from 1 to N. People in Chefland are very friendly, friendliness of i-th city is given by Fi.\n\nBefore starting of each trip, Chef's initial enjoyment is 1 unit. Whenever he visits a city with friendliness Fi, his enjoyment gets multiplied by Fi units. \n\nCity 1 is the home city of Chef. He starts each trip from his home city. Before starting a trip, he chooses a parameter R which denotes that he will start from city 1, and go to city 1 + R, then to 1 + 2 * R, then to 1 + 3 * R, till 1 + i * R such that i is largest integer satisfying 1 + i * R \u2264 N.\n\nNow, Chef wants you to help him recreate his visit of the cities. Specifically, he will ask you Q queries, each of which can be of following two types.\n\n- 1 p f : friendliness of p-th city changes to f, i.e. Fp = f \n- 2 R   : Find out the total enjoyment Chef will have during this trip. As Chef does not like big numbers, he just asks you to output two things, first digit of the enjoyment and value of enjoyment modulo 109 + 7.\n\n-----Input-----\nThere is a single test case.\nFirst line of input contains a single integer N, denoting number of cities in Chefland.\nSecond line of the input contains N space separated integer - F1, F2, ..., FN, denoting the friendliness of the cities in order from 1 to N.\nNext line contains an integer Q, denoting number of queries.\n\nFor each of the next Q queries, each line corresponds to one of the two types of the query. First there will be an integer denoting the type of the query, followed by the actual query. For query of type 1, there will be three space separated integers \"1 p f\" as defined above. For query of type 2, there will be two space separated integers \"2 R \", as defined above.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each query of type 2, output two space separated integers, first digit of Chef's enjoyment in this trip followed by the value of enjoyment modulo 109 + 7.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n-  1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 105 \n-  1 \u2264 Fi \u2264 10^9 \n-  1 \u2264 f \u2264 10^9 \n-  1 \u2264 p \u2264 N \n-  1 \u2264 R \u2264 N \n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (5 points) : \n\n-  1 \u2264 N \u2264 10 \n-  1 \u2264 Q  \u2264 1000 \n-  1 \u2264 Fi \u2264 10 \n-  1 \u2264 f \u2264 10 \n\nSubtask #2 (15 points) : \n\n-  1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000 \n-  1 \u2264 Q  \u2264 100 \n-  1 \u2264 Fi \u2264 109 \n-  1 \u2264 f \u2264 1000 \n\nSubtask #3 (80 points) : \n\n- original constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n3\n2 1\n1 3 10\n2 2\n\nOutput:\n1 120\n5 50\n\n-----Explanation-----\nIn the first query, Chef is going to visit cities 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in order. At the end of the trip, his total enjoyment will be 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. First digit of enjoyment is 1 and 120 modulo 109 + 7 is 120.\nIn the third query, Chef is going to visit cities 1, 3, 5 in order. At the end of the trip, his total enjoyment will be 1 * 10 * 5 = 50.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
