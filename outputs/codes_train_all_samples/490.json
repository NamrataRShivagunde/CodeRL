and you start in room 0.\u00a0 Each room has a distinct number in 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1, and each room may have\u00a0some keys to access the next room.\u00a0\nFormally, each room i\u00a0has a list of keys rooms[i], and each key rooms[i][j] is an integer in [0, 1, ..., N-1] where N = rooms.length.\u00a0 A key rooms[i][j] = v\u00a0opens the room with number v.\nInitially, all the rooms start locked (except for room 0).\u00a0\nYou can walk back and forth between rooms freely.\nReturn true\u00a0if and only if you can enter\u00a0every room.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [[1],[2],[3],[]]\nOutput: true\nExplanation:  \nWe start in room 0, and pick up key 1.\nWe then go to room 1, and pick up key 2.\nWe then go to room 2, and pick up key 3.\nWe then go to room 3.  Since we were able to go to every room, we return true.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: We can't enter the room with number 2.\n\nNote:\n\n1 <= rooms.length <=\u00a01000\n0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000\nThe number of keys in all rooms combined is at most\u00a03000.\nclass Solution:\n    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
