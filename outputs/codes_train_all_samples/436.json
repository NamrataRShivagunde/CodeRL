these oranges every day as follows:\n\nEat one orange.\nIf the number of remaining oranges (n) is divisible by 2 then you can eat\u00a0 n/2 oranges.\nIf the number of remaining oranges (n) is divisible by 3\u00a0then you can eat\u00a0 2*(n/3)\u00a0oranges.\n\nYou can only choose one of the actions per day.\nReturn the minimum number of days to eat n oranges.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 10\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: You have 10 oranges.\nDay 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9.  \nDay 2: Eat 6 oranges, 9 - 2*(9/3) = 9 - 6 = 3. (Since 9 is divisible by 3)\nDay 3: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. \nDay 4: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.\nYou need at least 4 days to eat the 10 oranges.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 6\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: You have 6 oranges.\nDay 1: Eat 3 oranges, 6 - 6/2 = 6 - 3 = 3. (Since 6 is divisible by 2).\nDay 2: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. (Since 3 is divisible by 3)\nDay 3: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.\nYou need at least 3 days to eat the 6 oranges.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 4:\nInput: n = 56\nOutput: 6\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 2*10^9\nclass Solution:\n    def minDays(self, n: int) -> int:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
