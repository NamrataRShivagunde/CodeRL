Each of those integers can be either 0 or 1. He's allowed to do exactly one move: he chooses two indices i and j (1\u2009\u2264\u2009i\u2009\u2264\u2009j\u2009\u2264\u2009n) and flips all values ak for which their positions are in range [i,\u2009j] (that is i\u2009\u2264\u2009k\u2009\u2264\u2009j). Flip the value of x means to apply operation x\u2009=\u20091 - x.\n\u2002The goal of the game is that after exactly one move to obtain the maximum number of ones. Write a program to solve the little game of Iahub.\n```\n@param {Array} line of the input there are n integers: a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009an. 1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009100. It is guaranteed that each of those n values is either 0 or 1\n@return {Integer} the maximal number of 1s that can be obtained after exactly one move\n```\nExamples :\n```\n[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  =>  5\n[1, 0, 0, 1]  =>  4\n\n```\nNote:\n\u2002In the first case, flip the segment from 2 to 6 (i\u2009=\u20092,\u2009j\u2009=\u20096). That flip changes the sequence, it becomes: [1 1 1 0 1 1]. So, it contains four ones. There is no way to make the whole sequence equal to [1 1 1 1 1 1].\n\u2002In the second case, flipping only the second and the third element (i\u2009=\u20092,\u2009j\u2009=\u20093) will turn all numbers into 1.\n\n(c)ll931110 & fchirica\ndef flipping_game(num):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
