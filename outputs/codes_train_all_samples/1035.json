This game is played on a $R \\times C$ board where each cell $(i, j)$ contains some value $V_{i, j}$. The purpose of this game is to collect a number of values by teleporting from one cell to another. A teleportation can be performed using a tel-pair.\nA player is given $N$ tel-pairs. Each tel-pair can be used at most once and a player can use them in any order they like. Suppose a player is at cell $(a, b)$ and the tel-pair is $(dx, dy)$. Then, the player can reach in one teleportation any cell $(c, d)$ from $(a, b)$ such that $|a \u2212 c| = dx$ and $|b \u2212 d| = dy$.\nIt is Mathison\u2019s turn next in the game to make a sequence of moves. He would like to know what is the highest value of a path of length at most $N+1$ that starts in $(Sx, Sy)$ and uses some (possibly none) of the tel-pairs given. The length of a path is equal to the number of cells in the path. The value of a path is equal to the sum of $V_{i, j}$ over all cells in the path.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line contains a single integer, $T$, the number of tests.\n- Each test starts with three integers, $R$, $C$, and $N$, representing the number of rows, columns, and tel-pairs.\n- The next line contains two integers, $Sx$, and $Sy$, representing the coordinates of the starting cell.\n- The next two lines will contain the description of the tel-pairs, each containing $N$ space separated integers. The first will contain the $x$-component of each tel-pair, the second one will contain the y-component of each tel-pair.\n- Finally, there will be $R$ lines, each containing $C$ space-separated integers, the description of the board.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output file will contain $T$ lines. Each line will contain the answer (i.e. the highest value of a path) to the corresponding test.\n\n-----Constraints and notes-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq R, C \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 9$\n- $0 \\leq Sx < R$\n- $0 \\leq Sy < C$\n- $0 \\leq dx \\leq R$\n- $0 \\leq dy \\leq C$\n- $1 \\leq V_{i, j} \\leq 10^6$\n- You are allowed to visit a cell multiple times in a path, and the value for the cell must be added each time you visit it. \n\n-----Subtaks-----\nSubtask #1 (15 points):\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq R, C \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 4$\nSubtask #2 (25 points):\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 25$\n- $1 \\leq R, C \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 8$\nSubtask #3 (30 points):\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 5$\n- $1 \\leq R, C \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 8$\nSubtask #4 (30 points):\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 5$\n- $1 \\leq R, C \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 9$\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3\n5 5 2\n2 2\n1 2\n2 1\n10 11 62 14 15\n57 23 34 75 21\n17 12 14 11 53\n84 61 24 85 22\n43 89 14 15 43\n3 3 2\n0 0\n1 1\n1 1\n9 8 7\n5 6 4\n1 3 2\n2 2 1\n1 1\n2\n2\n5 6\n8 3\n\n-----Example Output-----\n188\n24\n3\n\n-----Explanation-----\nTest Case 1:\nMathison starts at $(2, 2)$.\nMathison has two tel-pairs $(2, 1)$ and $(1, 2)$.\nThe following path (i.e. bolded numbers) generates the maximum value: $(2, 2)$ \u2192 $(4, 1)$ \u2192 $(3, 3)$\nTest Case 2:\nMathison starts at $(0, 0)$.\nMathison has two tel-pairs $(1, 1)$ and $(1, 1)$.\nThe following path (i.e. bolded numbers) generates the maximum value: $(0, 0)$ \u2192 $(1, 1)$ \u2192 $(0, 0)$\nTest Case 3:\nMathison starts at $(1, 1)$.\nMathison has one tel-pair, $(2, 2)$.\nHe can't use the tel-pair so the answer is $3$ (the value of the starting cell).\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
