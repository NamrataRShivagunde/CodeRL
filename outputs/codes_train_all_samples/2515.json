composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.\nWe would like to convert the sentence to \"Goat Latin\"\u00a0(a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.)\nThe rules of Goat Latin are as follows:\n\nIf a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append \"ma\"\u00a0to the end of the word.\n        For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.\n        \u00a0\nIf a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add \"ma\".\n        For example, the word \"goat\"\u00a0becomes \"oatgma\".\n        \u00a0\nAdd one letter 'a'\u00a0to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.\n        For example,\u00a0the first word gets \"a\" added to the end, the second word gets \"aa\" added to the end and so on.\n\nReturn the\u00a0final sentence representing the conversion from S\u00a0to Goat\u00a0Latin.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: \"I speak Goat Latin\"\nOutput: \"Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa\"\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\"\nOutput: \"heTmaa uickqmaaa rownbmaaaa oxfmaaaaa umpedjmaaaaaa overmaaaaaaa hetmaaaaaaaa azylmaaaaaaaaa ogdmaaaaaaaaaa\"\n\n\u00a0\nNotes:\n\nS contains only uppercase, lowercase and spaces.\u00a0Exactly one space between each word.\n1 <= S.length <= 150.\nclass Solution:\n    def toGoatLatin(self, S: str) -> str:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
