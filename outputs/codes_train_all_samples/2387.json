Initially, he has $s$ burles on his card. \n\nMishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose some positive integer number $1 \\le x \\le s$, buy food that costs exactly $x$ burles and obtain $\\lfloor\\frac{x}{10}\\rfloor$ burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends $x$ burles and obtains $\\lfloor\\frac{x}{10}\\rfloor$ back). The operation $\\lfloor\\frac{a}{b}\\rfloor$ means $a$ divided by $b$ rounded down.\n\nIt is guaranteed that you can always buy some food that costs $x$ for any possible value of $x$.\n\nYour task is to say the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.\n\nFor example, if Mishka has $s=19$ burles then the maximum number of burles he can spend is $21$. Firstly, he can spend $x=10$ burles, obtain $1$ burle as a cashback. Now he has $s=10$ burles, so can spend $x=10$ burles, obtain $1$ burle as a cashback and spend it too.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next $t$ lines describe test cases.
