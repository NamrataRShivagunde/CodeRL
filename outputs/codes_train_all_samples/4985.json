Now it's time to present it to a band that will perform your piece, but there's a problem! The singers vocal range doesn't stretch as your piece requires, and you have to transpose the whole piece.*\n\n# Your task\nGiven a list of notes (represented as strings) and an interval, output a list of transposed notes in *sharp* notation.\n\n**Input notes may be represented both in flat and sharp notations (more on that below).**\n\n**For this kata, assume that input is always valid and the song is *at least* 1 note long.**\n\n**Assume that interval is an integer between -12 and 12.**\n\n# Short intro to musical notation\nTransposing a single note means shifting its value by a certain interval.\n\nThe notes are as following:\n\n    A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#.\n\nThis is using *sharp* notation, where '#' after a note means that it is one step higher than the note. So A# is one step higher than A.\n\nAn alternative to sharp notation is the *flat* notation:\n\n    A, Bb, B, C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Gb, G, Ab.\n\nThe 'b' after a note means that it is one step lower than the note.\n\n# Examples\n\n    ['G'] -> 5 steps -> ['C']\n    ['Db'] -> -4 steps -> ['A#']\n    ['E', 'F'] -> 1 step -> ['F', 'F#']\ndef transpose(song, interval):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
