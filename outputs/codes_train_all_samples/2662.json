Winner is the one with the most hits.\n\nSome of the clays have something attached to create lots of smoke when hit, guarenteed by the packaging to generate 'real excitement!' (genuinely this happened). None of the explosive things actually worked, but for this kata lets say they did.\n\nFor each round you will receive the following format:\n\n[{P1:'XX', P2:'XO'}, true]\n\nThat is an array containing an object and a boolean. Pl represents Pete, P2 represents Phil. X represents a hit and O represents a miss. If the boolean is true, any hit is worth 2. If it is false, any hit is worth 1.\n\nFind out who won. If it's Pete, return 'Pete Wins!'. If it is Phil, return 'Phil Wins!'. If the scores are equal, return 'Draw!'.\n\nNote that as there are three rounds, the actual input (x) will look something like this:\n\n[[{P1:'XX', P2:'XO'}, true], [{P1:'OX', P2:'OO'}, false], [{P1:'XX', P2:'OX'}, true]]\ndef shoot(results):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
