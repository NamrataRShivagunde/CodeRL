"prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAlex and Lee play a game with piles of stones.\u00a0 There are an even number of\u00a0piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].\nThe objective of the game is to end with the most\u00a0stones.\u00a0 The total number of stones is odd, so there are no ties.\nAlex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.\u00a0 Each turn, a player\u00a0takes the entire pile of stones from either the beginning or the end of the row.\u00a0 This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.\nAssuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return True\u00a0if and only if Alex wins the game.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: piles = [5,3,4,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nAlex starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.\nSay he takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].\nIf Lee takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alex takes 5 to win with 10 points.\nIf Lee takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alex takes 4 to win with 9 points.\nThis demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alex, so we return true.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= piles.length <= 500\npiles.length is even.\n1 <= piles[i] <= 500\nsum(piles) is odd.\nclass Solution:\n    def stoneGame(self, piles: List[int]) -> bool:\n\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
