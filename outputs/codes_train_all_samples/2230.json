Each of the t-shirts is characterized by three integers p_{i}, a_{i} and b_{i}, where p_{i} is the price of the i-th t-shirt, a_{i} is front color of the i-th t-shirt and b_{i} is back color of the i-th t-shirt. All values p_{i} are distinct, and values a_{i} and b_{i} are integers from 1 to 3.\n\nm buyers will come to the shop. Each of them wants to buy exactly one t-shirt. For the j-th buyer we know his favorite color c_{j}.\n\nA buyer agrees to buy a t-shirt, if at least one side (front or back) is painted in his favorite color. Among all t-shirts that have colors acceptable to this buyer he will choose the cheapest one. If there are no such t-shirts, the buyer won't buy anything. Assume that the buyers come one by one, and each buyer is served only after the previous one is served.\n\nYou are to compute the prices each buyer will pay for t-shirts.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of t-shirts.\n\nThe following line contains sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 1 000 000 000), where p_{i} equals to the price of the i-th t-shirt.\n\nThe following line contains sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 3), where a_{i} equals to the front color of the i-th t-shirt.\n\nThe following line contains sequence of integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 \u2264 b_{i} \u2264 3), where b_{i} equals to the back color of the i-th t-shirt.\n\nThe next line contains single integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of buyers. \n\nThe following line contains sequence c_1, c_2, ..., c_{m} (1 \u2264 c_{j} \u2264 3), where c_{j} equals to the favorite color of the j-th buyer. The buyers will come to the shop in the order they are given in the input. Each buyer is served only after the previous one is served.\n\n \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint to the first line m integers \u2014 the j-th integer should be equal to the price of the t-shirt which the j-th buyer will buy. If the j-th buyer won't buy anything, print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n300 200 400 500 911\n1 2 1 2 3\n2 1 3 2 1\n6\n2 3 1 2 1 1\n\nOutput\n200 400 300 500 911 -1 \n\nInput\n2\n1000000000 1\n1 1\n1 2\n2\n2 1\n\nOutput\n1 1000000000\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
