He asks each one to cook a dish and present it to him.\nChef loves his secret ingredient, and only likes dishes with at least $X$ grams of it.\nGiven $N$, $X$ and the amount of secret ingredient used by each student $A_i$, find out whether Chef will like at least one dish. \n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- The first line of each testcase contains two integers $N$ \n(number of students) and $X$ (minimum amount of secret ingredient that a dish must contain for Chef to like it).\n- The next line contains $N$ space separated integers, $A_i$ denoting the amount of secret ingredient used by the students in their dishes.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase, print a single string \"YES\" if Chef likes at least one dish. Otherwise, print \"NO\".
