Sadly, you have to help Chef once again. Dr Doof has designed a parenthesis-inator. It throws a stream of $N$ brackets at the target, $1$ bracket per second. The brackets can either be opening or closing. Chef appears in front of the stream at time $t$. If Chef faces an opening bracket, he gets hit. However, if he faces a closing bracket, he may choose to let it pass through him (Chef is immune to closing brackets). Chef gets a chance to counter attack Doof as soon as he finds a balanced non-empty bracket sequence. Help Chef by providing him the minimum time $x$ at which he will be able to launch his counter attack. If Chef is unable to counter attack, answer $-1$.\nFormally, you are given a string $S$ of length $N$ consisting only of opening brackets $($ and closing brackets $)$. The substring of $S$ starting at index $L$ and ending at index $R$, i.e. $S_L S_{L+1} \\ldots S_{R}$ is denoted by $S[L, R]$ . Consider $Q$ cases. In the $i^{\\text{th}}$ case, Chef appears at time $t_i$ $(1 \\leq t_i \\leq N)$ and faces all characters from index $t_i$ to $N$. Find the minimum index $x$ $(t_i \\leq x \\leq N)$ such that the substring $S[t_i, x]$ contains a non-empty balanced bracket subsequence containing the same number of opening brackets as $S[t_i, x]$ (i.e., you cannot remove any opening bracket from the substring). If such an $x$ does not exist, print $-1$.\nA string $X$ is called a subsequence of a string $Y$ if it is possible to obtain $X$ by erasing some (possibly zero) characters from $Y$ without changing the order of the remaining characters.\nA balanced bracket sequence is defined as:  \n- an empty string is a balanced bracket sequence.\n- if $s$ is a balanced bracket sequence, then so is $(s)$.\n- if $s$ and $t$ are balanced bracket sequences, then so is $st$.\n$Note :-$ The input files are large. The use of Fast I/O is recommended.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of testcases.\n- The first line of each test case contains the string $S$.\n- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of cases to consider.\n- The next line contains $Q$ space separated integers, each denoting $t_i$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each query, print the minimum value of $x$ in a separate line. If no such $x$ exists, print $-1$.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq |S| \\leq 10^7$\n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^6$\n- $1 \\leq t_i \\leq N$\n- Every character of $S$ is either $($ or $)$.\n- Sum of $|S|$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $10^7$ and $10^6$ respectively.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n1\n)())((()\n3\n1 7 6\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n3\n8\n-1\n\n-----Explanation-----\nFor the first query, Chef chooses to let $S_1$ pass through him, gets hit by $S_2$ and finally completes a balanced bracket sequence by adding $S_3$ to $S_2$ at time $x$ = $3$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
