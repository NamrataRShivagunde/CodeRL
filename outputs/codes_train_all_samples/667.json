Her journey consists of $N$ bus routes, numbered from $1 to N$ in the order she must take them. The buses themselves are very fast but do not run often. The $i-th$ bus route only runs every $Xi$ days.\n\nMore specifically, she can only take the $i-th$ bus on day $Xi, 2Xi, 3Xi$, and so on. Since the buses are very fast, she can take multiple buses on the same day.\n\nDiana must finish her journey by day D, but she would like to start the journey as late as possible. What is the latest day she could take the first bus, and still finish her journey by day $D$?\nIt is guaranteed that it is possible for Diana to finish her journey by day $D$.  \n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the two integers N and D. Then, another line follows containing $N$ integers, the $i-th$ one is $Xi$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, output one line containing an integer $Y$, where $Y$ is the latest day she could take the first bus, and still finish her journey by day $D$.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq Xi \\leq D.$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000.$\nIt is guaranteed that it is possible for Diana to finish her journey by day $D$.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n3\n\n3 10\n\n3 7 2\n\n4 100\n\n11 10 5 50\n\n1 1\n\n1  \n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n6  \n\n99\n\n1  \n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nIn Sample $Case 1$, there are $N = 3$ bus routes and Bucket must arrive by day $D = 10$. She could:\n- Take the 1st bus on day 6 $(X1 = 3)$,\n- Take the 2nd bus on day 7 $(X2 = 7)$ and\n- Take the 3rd bus on day 8 $(X3 = 2)$.  \nIn Sample $Case 2$, there are $N = 4$ bus routes and Bucket must arrive by day $D = 100$. She could:\n- Take the 1st bus on day 99 $(X1 = 11)$,\n- Take the 2nd bus on day 100$ (X2 = 10)$,\n- Take the 3rd bus on day 100 $(X3 = 5)$ and\n- Take the 4th bus on day 100 $(X4 = 50)$,  \nIn Sample Case 3, there is $N = 1$ bus route, and Bucket must arrive by day $D = 1$. She could:\n- Take the 1st bus on day 1 $(X1 = 1)$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
