Return the longest happy prefix\u00a0of s\u00a0.\nReturn an empty string if no such prefix exists.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"level\"\nOutput: \"l\"\nExplanation: s contains 4 prefix excluding itself (\"l\", \"le\", \"lev\", \"leve\"), and suffix (\"l\", \"el\", \"vel\", \"evel\"). The largest prefix which is also suffix is given by \"l\".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"ababab\"\nOutput: \"abab\"\nExplanation: \"abab\" is the largest prefix which is also suffix.
