More precisely, you want everyone to vote for you.\n\nThere are $n$ voters, and two ways to convince each of them to vote for you. The first way to convince the $i$-th voter is to pay him $p_i$ coins. The second way is to make $m_i$ other voters vote for you, and the $i$-th voter will vote for free.\n\nMoreover, the process of such voting takes place in several steps. For example, if there are five voters with $m_1 = 1$, $m_2 = 2$, $m_3 = 2$, $m_4 = 4$, $m_5 = 5$, then you can buy the vote of the fifth voter, and eventually everyone will vote for you. Set of people voting for you will change as follows: ${5} \\rightarrow {1, 5} \\rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 5} \\rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$.\n\nCalculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend so that everyone votes for you.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 5000$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 5000$) \u2014 the number of voters.\n\nThe next $n$ lines contains the description of voters. $i$-th line contains two integers $m_i$ and $p_i$ ($1 \\le p_i \\le 10^9, 0 \\le m_i < n$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5000$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of coins you have to spend so that everyone votes for you.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n3\n1 5\n2 10\n2 8\n7\n0 1\n3 1\n1 1\n6 1\n1 1\n4 1\n4 1\n6\n2 6\n2 3\n2 8\n2 7\n4 4\n5 5\n\nOutput\n8\n0\n7\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case you have to buy vote of the third voter. Then the set of people voting for you will change as follows: ${3} \\rightarrow {1, 3} \\rightarrow {1, 2, 3}$.\n\nIn the second example you don't need to buy votes. The set of people voting for you will change as follows: ${1} \\rightarrow {1, 3, 5} \\rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 5} \\rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7} \\rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}$.\n\nIn the third test case you have to buy votes of the second and the fifth voters. Then the set of people voting for you will change as follows: ${2, 5} \\rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} \\rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
