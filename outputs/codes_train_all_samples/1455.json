Sometimes he studies hard; at other times he plays truant and gets busy with other things besides academics. He has already studied at the university for N months. For the ith month (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N), he has received some non-negative integer grade A[i].\nNow he wants to analyse his progress for some periods of his university education. An arbitrary period, defined by two positive integers L and R, begins at Leha's Lth month at the university and ends at the Rth. The analysis is performed via the following steps.\n\n1. Write down all the grades for each month from L to R and sort them. Let's call the sorted list S.\n\n2. Calculate the sum of squared differences of consecutive elements in S, that is, (S[2] - S[1])2 + (S[3] - S[2])2 + ... + (S[R-L+1] - S[R-L])2.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains one integer N \u2014 the number of months Leha has already studied at the university.\nThe second line contains N integers \u2014 list A of Leha's grades.\nThe third line contains one integer M \u2014 the number of periods Leha is interested in analyzing.\nEach of the following M lines contain two integers L and R describing each period.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each query, output one integer \u2014 the result of the progress analysis for the corresponding period.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 5*104\n- 0 \u2264 A[i] \u2264 106\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 (19 points) 1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 200, time limit = 2 sec\n- Subtask 2 (31 points) 1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 10 000, time limit = 2 sec\n- Subtask 3 (26 points) 0 \u2264 A[i] \u2264 100, time limit = 5 sec\n- Subtask 4 (24 points) no additional constraints, , time limit = 5 sec\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:5\n1 3 2 4 5\n5\n1 5\n1 4\n2 4\n3 3\n3 5\n\nOutput:4\n3\n2\n0\n5\n\nExplanation\n\nThe first query: sorted array looks like (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and the answer is calculated as (2-1)2 + (3-2)2 + (4-3)2 + (5-4)2 = 4\n\nThe second query: sorted array looks like (1, 2, 3, 4) and the answer is calculated as (2-1)2 + (3-2)2 + (4-3)2 = 3\n\nThe last query: sorted array looks like (2, 4, 5) and the answer is calculated as (4-2)2 + (5-4)2 = 5\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
