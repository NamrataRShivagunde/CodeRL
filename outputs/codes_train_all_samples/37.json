Then we do the following: while there is at least one not marked element in $p$, we find the leftmost such element, list all elements that are reachable from it in the order they appear in $p$, mark all of these elements, then cyclically shift the list of those elements so that the maximum appears at the first position, and add this list as an element of $l$. After all elements are marked, $l$ is the result of this decomposition.\n\nFor example, if we want to build a decomposition of $p = [5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 8, 6]$, we do the following:  initially $p = [5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 8, 6]$ (bold elements are marked), $l = []$;  the leftmost unmarked element is $5$; $5$ and $1$ are reachable from it, so the list we want to shift is $[5, 1]$; there is no need to shift it, since maximum is already the first element;  $p = [\\textbf{5}, 4, 2, 3, \\textbf{1}, 7, 8, 6]$, $l = [[5, 1]]$;  the leftmost unmarked element is $4$, the list of reachable elements is $[4, 2, 3]$; the maximum is already the first element, so there's no need to shift it;  $p = [\\textbf{5}, \\textbf{4}, \\textbf{2}, \\textbf{3}, \\textbf{1}, 7, 8, 6]$, $l = [[5, 1], [4, 2, 3]]$;  the leftmost unmarked element is $7$, the list of reachable elements is $[7, 8, 6]$; we have to shift it, so it becomes $[8, 6, 7]$;  $p = [\\textbf{5}, \\textbf{4}, \\textbf{2}, \\textbf{3}, \\textbf{1}, \\textbf{7}, \\textbf{8}, \\textbf{6}]$, $l = [[5, 1], [4, 2, 3], [8, 6, 7]]$;  all elements are marked, so $[[5, 1], [4, 2, 3], [8, 6, 7]]$ is the result. \n\nThe New Year transformation of a permutation is defined as follows: we build the decomposition of this permutation; then we sort all lists in decomposition in ascending order of the first elements (we don't swap the elements in these lists, only the lists themselves); then we concatenate the lists into one list which becomes a new permutation. For example, the New Year transformation of $p = [5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 8, 6]$ is built as follows:  the decomposition is $[[5, 1], [4, 2, 3], [8, 6, 7]]$;  after sorting the decomposition, it becomes $[[4, 2, 3], [5, 1], [8, 6, 7]]$;  $[4, 2, 3, 5, 1, 8, 6, 7]$ is the result of the transformation. \n\nWe call a permutation good if the result of its transformation is the same as the permutation itself. For example, $[4, 3, 1, 2, 8, 5, 6, 7]$ is a good permutation; and $[5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 7, 8, 6]$ is bad, since the result of transformation is $[4, 2, 3, 5, 1, 8, 6, 7]$.\n\nYour task is the following: given $n$ and $k$, find the $k$-th (lexicographically) good permutation of length $n$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThen the test cases follow. Each test case is represented by one line containing two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$, $1 \\le k \\le 10^{18}$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer to it as follows: if the number of good permutations of length $n$ is less than $k$, print one integer $-1$; otherwise, print the $k$-th good permutation on $n$ elements (in lexicographical order).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n3 3\n5 15\n4 13\n6 8\n4 2\n\nOutput\n2 1 3 \n3 1 2 5 4 \n-1\n1 2 6 3 4 5 \n1 2 4 3\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
