plane and drop them in the forest.\n\nThe terrain is dangerous and surveyors have determined that there are three possible safe *dropzones*, an array of three simple arrays with x, y coordinates. \n\nThe plane is en route and time is of the essence. Your mission is to return a simple [x,y] array with the coordinates of the dropzone closest to the fire. \n\nEDIT: \nThe airplane is leaving from the origin at 0,0. If your result returns two possible dropzones that are both an equal distance from the fire, choose the dropzone that is closest to 0,0.\n\nIf the two dropzones are both equal distance away from 0,0, then return the dropzone that is first in the given array. \n\nFor example, if you are given: fire = [1,1], possibleDZ = [0,1],[1,0],[2,2] . The answer is [0,1] because that is the first possible drop zone in the given array.\ndef dropzone(p, dropzones):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
