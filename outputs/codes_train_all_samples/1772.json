It is named after a later French cryptographer Blaise de Vigen\u00e8re, who had developed a stronger autokey cipher (a cipher that incorporates the message of the text into the key). \n\nThe cipher is easy to understand and implement, but survived three centuries of attempts to break it, earning it the nickname \"le chiffre ind\u00e9chiffrable\" or \"the indecipherable cipher.\"\n\n[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher):\n\n> The Vigen\u00e8re cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It is a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.\n>\n> . . .\n>\n> In a Caesar cipher, each letter of the alphabet is shifted along some number of places; for example, in a Caesar cipher of shift `3`, `A` would become `D`, `B` would become `E`, `Y` would become `B` and so on. The Vigen\u00e8re cipher consists of several Caesar ciphers in sequence with different shift values.\n\nAssume the key is repeated for the length of the text, character by character. Note that some implementations repeat the key over characters only if they are part of the alphabet -- **this is not the case here.**\n\nThe shift is derived by applying a Caesar shift to a character with the corresponding index of the key in the alphabet.\n\nVisual representation:\nWrite a class that, when given a key and an alphabet, can be used to encode and decode from the cipher.\n\n## Example\nAny character not in the alphabet must be left as is. For example (following from above):\ndef __init__(self, key, alphabet):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
