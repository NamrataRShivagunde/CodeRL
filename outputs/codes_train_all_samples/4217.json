month will have an `Extended Weekend`. That is, it could have five Fridays, five Saturdays and five Sundays. \n\nIn this Kata, you will be given a start year and an end year. Your task will be to find months that have extended weekends and return:\n```\n- The first and last month in the range that has an extended weekend\n- The number of months that have extended weekends in the range, inclusive of start year and end year.\n```\n\nFor example:\n```python\nsolve(2016,2020) = (\"Jan\",\"May\",5). #The months are: Jan 2016, Jul 2016, Dec 2017, Mar 2019, May 2020\n```\n\nMore examples in test cases.
