Emily got Mia\u2019s essay paper, but since she is a prankster, she decided to meddle with the words present in the paper. She changes all the words in the paper into palindromes. To do this, she follows two rules: \n- In one operation she can only reduce the value of an alphabet by 1, i.e.  she can change \u2018d\u2019 to \u2018c\u2019, but she cannot change \u2018c\u2019 to \u2018d\u2019 or \u2018d\u2019 to \u2018b\u2019. \n- The alphabet \u2018a\u2019 will not be reduced any further. \nEach reduction in the value of any alphabet is counted as a single operation. Find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given string into a palindrome.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. \n- Each test case consists of a string $S$ containing only lowercase characters with no spaces.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case on a new line, print the minimum number of operations for the corresponding test case.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1<=T<=10$\n- $1<=|S|<=10^7$, where $|S|$ denotes length of string S.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n4 \nabc \nabcba \nabcd \ncba\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n2 \n0\n4\n2\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nFor the first test case string = \u201cabc\u201d \nc->b->a so the string become \u201caba\u201d which is a palindrome. For this we perform 2 operations\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
