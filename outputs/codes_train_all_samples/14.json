He cut it into two rectangular parts using one vertical or horizontal cut. Then Vasya informed you the dimensions of these two rectangular parts. You need to check whether Vasya originally had a square. In other words, check if it is possible to make a square using two given rectangles.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input.

The sizes are given in random order (that is, it is not known which of the numbers is the width, and which of the numbers is the length).\n\nThe second line contains two integers $a_2$ and $b_2$ ($1 \\le a_2, b_2 \\le 100$) \u2014 the dimensions of the second obtained after cutting rectangle.
