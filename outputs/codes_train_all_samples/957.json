( $1 <= i <= N$ )\n\nEach of these positions are pairwise distinct \nMiu is supposed to choose one of these houses for herself.\n\nMiu defines a term - The Distance of Peace,  as the minimum distance from her house to any other house.  \nMiu wonders what is maximum Distance of Peace she can obtain.
