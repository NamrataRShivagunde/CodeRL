of n points in 5-dimensional space. The points are labeled from 1 to n. No two points coincide.\n\nWe will call point a bad if there are different points b and c, not equal to a, from the given set such that angle between vectors $\\vec{ab}$ and $\\vec{ac}$ is acute (i.e. strictly less than $90^{\\circ}$). Otherwise, the point is called good.\n\nThe angle between vectors $\\vec{x}$ and $\\vec{y}$ in 5-dimensional space is defined as $\\operatorname{arccos}(\\frac{\\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{y}}{|\\vec{x}||\\vec{y}|})$, where $\\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{y} = x_{1} y_{1} + x_{2} y_{2} + x_{3} y_{3} + x_{4} y_{4} + x_{5} y_{5}$ is the scalar product and $|\\vec{x}|= \\sqrt{\\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{x}}$ is length of $\\vec{x}$.\n\nGiven the list of points, print the indices of the good points in ascending order.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^3)\u00a0\u2014 the number of points.\n\nThe next n lines of input contain five integers a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i}, d_{i}, e_{i} (|a_{i}|, |b_{i}|, |c_{i}|, |d_{i}|, |e_{i}| \u2264 10^3) \u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the i-th point.
