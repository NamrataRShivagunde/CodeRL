climbers\n\nIn this kata you will be given a leaderboard of unique names for example:\n\n```python\n['John',\n 'Brian',\n 'Jim',\n 'Dave',\n 'Fred']\n```\n\nThen you will be given a list of strings for example:\n\n```python\n['Dave +1', 'Fred +4', 'Brian -1']\n```\n\nThen you sort the leaderboard.\n\nThe steps for our example would be:\n\n```python\n# Dave up 1\n['John',\n 'Brian',\n 'Dave',\n 'Jim',\n 'Fred']\n```\n\n```python\n# Fred up 4\n['Fred',\n 'John',\n 'Brian',\n 'Dave',\n 'Jim']\n```\n\n```python\n# Brian down 1\n['Fred',\n 'John',\n 'Dave',\n 'Brian',\n 'Jim']\n```\n\nThen once you have done this you need to return the leaderboard.\n\nAll inputs will be valid. All strings in the second list will never ask to move a name up higher or lower than possible eg. `\"John +3\"` could not be added to the end of the second input list in the example above.\n\nThe strings in the second list will always be something in the leaderboard followed by a space and a `+` or `-` sign followed by a number.\ndef leaderboard_sort(leaderboard, changes):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
