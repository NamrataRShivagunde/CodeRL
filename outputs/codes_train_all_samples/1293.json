He further tells Chef that A1 = 0. The game is for Chef to guess the sequence that Miron thought of. \nBut Miron is an adversarial player. Every time Chef tries to guess the sequence, he makes a change to the matrix. He makes such a change Q times. Each time, he replaces an entry in some row and the corresponding column with a new one leaving Chef to guess the sequence after each change. \nChef needs a friend to help him against such an adversarial player. Can you be that friend and help Chef find a suitable sequence A for the initial matrix B and also after each change Miron makes? \nNote that if several answers exist, then print the lexicographically smallest answer. Further, the numbers in the sequence can be negative.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers N, Q. Each of the N subsequent lines contains N space-separated integers, denoting the matrix B.\n\nQ queries follow. Each query has two lines. The first line of each query contains an integer p, denoting the number of row and column that is changed. The second line of each query contains N space-separated integers F1, F2, F3, ... FN, denoting the new values to the corresponding cells of the matrix (you should make the following assignments Bi,p = Bp,i = Fi for all valid i). \n\n-----Output-----\nPrint Q + 1 lines which contain N space-separated integers, Miron's initial array and Miron's array after each query.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 3 \u2264 N \u2264  1000 \n- 1 \u2264 Q \u2264  1000 \n- 0 \u2264 Bi,j \u2264  5000 \n- 1 \u2264 p \u2264  n \n- 0 \u2264 Fi \u2264  5000 \n- it's guaranteed there's always an answer\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n3 2\n0 1 2\n1 0 1\n2 1 0\n1\n0 4 3\n2\n4 0 7\nOutput:\n0 -1 -2\n0 -4 -3\n0 -4 3\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1.
