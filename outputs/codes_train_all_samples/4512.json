The next possible number that does not have a `1` or a `0` is `22`. All other numbers between `10` and `22` have a `1` or a `0`. \n\nFrom `22`, the next number that does not have a `2` is `11`. Note that `30` is also a possibility because it is the next *higher* number that does not have a `2`, but we must select  the *lowest* number that fits and **is not already in the sequence**. \n\nFrom `11`, the next lowest number that does not have a `1` is `20`. \n\nFrom `20`, the next lowest number that does not have a `2` or a `0` is `13`, then `24` , then `15` and so on. \n\nOnce a number appers in the series, it cannot appear again. \n\nYou will be given an index number and your task will be return the element at that position. See test cases for more examples.\n\nNote that the test range is `n <= 500`. \n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you like this Kata, please try:\n\n[Sequence convergence](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59971e64bfccc70748000068)\n\n[https://www.codewars.com/kata/unique-digit-sequence-ii-optimization-problem](https://www.codewars.com/kata/unique-digit-sequence-ii-optimization-problem)\ndef find_num(n):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
