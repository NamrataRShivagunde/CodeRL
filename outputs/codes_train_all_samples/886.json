He gave his friend a list of N numbers named $a_1, a_2 ....  a_N$ (Note: All numbers are unique). Adjust the numbers in the following order:\n$(i)$ swap every alternate number with it's succeeding number (If N is odd, do not swap the last number i.e. $a_N$ ).\n$(ii)$ add %3 of every number to itself.\n$(iii)$ swap the ith number and the (N-i-1) th number.\nAfter this, Chef will give a number to his friend and he has to give the nearest greater and smaller number to it.\nIf there is no greater or lesser number, put -1.\nHelp his friend to find the two numbers.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases.
