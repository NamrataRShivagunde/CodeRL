He's heard that \nmaking sure he has the right amount of wallpaper is more complex than it sounds. \nHe wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.\n\nJohn knows that the rectangular room has a length of `l` meters, a width of `w` meters, a height of `h` meters.\nThe standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is `52` centimeters. The \nlength of a roll is `10` meters.\nHe bears in mind however, that it\u2019s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length `15%` greater than the one he needs.\n\nLast time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John? Your function `wallpaper(l, w, h)` should return as a plain English word\nin lower case the number of rolls he must buy.\n\n### Example:\n\n`wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return \"ten\"`\n\n`wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return \"zero\"`\n\n# Notes:\n- all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge \n- 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers), it can happens that `w x h x l` is zero\n- the integer `r` (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20\n\n\n- FORTH: the number of rolls will be a *positive or null integer* (not a plain English word; this number can be greater than 20)\ndef wallpaper(l, w, h):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
