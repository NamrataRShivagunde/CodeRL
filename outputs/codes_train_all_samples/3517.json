The parade passes through the street where your house is. Your house is at number `location` of the street. Write a function `parade_time` that will tell you the times when you need to appear to see all appearences of that group.\n\n## Specifications\nYou'll be given:\n\n* A `list` of `string`s containing `groups` in the parade, in order of appearance. A group may appear multiple times. You want to see all the parts of your favorite group.\n* An positive `integer` with the `location` on the parade route where you'll be watching.\n* An positive `integer` with the `speed` of the parade\n* A `string` with the `pref`ferred group you'd like to see\n\nYou need to return the time(s) you need to be at the parade to see your favorite group as a `list` of `integer`s.\n\nIt's possible the group won't be at your `location` at an exact `time`. In that case, just be sure to get there right before it passes (i.e. the largest integer `time` before the float passes the `position`).\n\n## Example\n```python\ngroups = ['A','B','C','D','E','F']\nlocation = 3\nspeed = 2\npref = 'C'\n                  v\nLocations: |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|...\nF E D C B A      | |               time = 0\n> > F E D C B A  | |               time = 1\n    > > F E D C B|A|               time = 2\n        > > F E D|C|B A            time = 3\n                  ^\nparade_time(['A','B','C','D','E','F'], 3, 2,'C']) == [3]\n```\ndef parade_time(groups, location, speed, pref):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
