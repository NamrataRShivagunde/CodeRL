Specifically, you'd like to re-evaluate old findings in light of recent literature about [\"researcher degrees of freedom\"](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611417632).\n\nYou want to categorize all the old articles into three groups: \"Fine\", \"Needs review\" and \"Pants on fire\".\n\nIn order to categorize them you've enlisted an army of unpaid grad students to review and give you two data points from each study: (1) the p-value behind the paper's primary conclusions, and (2) the number of recommended author requirements to limit researcher degrees of freedom the authors satisfied:\n\n    * Authors must decide the rule for terminating data collection before data collection begins and report this rule in the article.\n    * Authors must collect at least 20 observations per cell or else provide a compelling cost-of-data-collection justification. \n    * Authors must list all variables collected in a study.\n    * Authors must report all experimental conditions, including failed manipulations.\n    * If observations are eliminated, authors must also report what the statistical results are if those observations are included.\n    * If an analysis includes a covariate, authors must report the statistical results of the analysis without the covariate.\n    \nYour army of tenure-hungry grad students will give you the p-value as a float between `1.0` and `0.0` exclusive, and the number of author requirements satisfied as an integer from `0` through `6` inclusive.\n\nYou've decided to write a function, `categorize_study()` to automatically categorize each study based on these two inputs using the completely scientifically legitimate \"bs-factor\". The bs-factor for a particular paper is calculated as follows:\n\n * bs-factor when the authors satisfy all six requirements is 1\n * bs-factor when the authors satisfy only five requirements is 2\n * bs-factor when the authors satisfy only four requirements is 4\n * bs-factor when the authors satisfy only three requirements is 8...\n\nYour function should multiply the p-value by the bs-factor and use that product to return one of the following strings:\n\n * product is less than 0.05: \"Fine\"\n * product is 0.05 to 0.15: \"Needs review\"\n * product is 0.15 or higher: \"Pants on fire\"\n \nYou've also decided that all studies meeting _none_ of the author requirements that would have been categorized as \"Fine\" should instead be categorized as \"Needs review\".\n\nFor example:\n\n`categorize_study(0.01, 3)` should return `\"Needs review\"` because the p-value times the bs-factor is `0.08`.\n\n`categorize_study(0.04, 6)` should return `\"Fine\"` because the p-value times the bs-factor is only `0.04`.\n\n`categorize_study(0.0001, 0)` should return `\"Needs review\"` even though the p-value times the bs-factor is only `0.0064`.\n\n`categorize_study(0.012, 0)` should return `\"Pants on fire\"` because the p-value times the bs-factor is `0.768`.\ndef categorize_study(p_value, requirements):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
