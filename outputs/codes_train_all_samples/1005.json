His boss at work shows him an online puzzle, which if solved would earn the solver a full expense paid trip to Los Angeles, California. Takaki really wants to solve this, as the love of his life, Akari, lives in Los Angeles and he hasn't met her since four years. Upon reading the puzzle he realizes that it is a query based problem. The problem is as follows :-\n\nYou are given a Tree T with N nodes numbered from 1 to N, with each node numbered z having a positive integer Az written on it. This integer denotes the value of the node. You have to process Q queries, of the following forms :- \n1) C x y : Report the closest two values in the unique path from x to y i.e compute min(|Ap - Aq|) where p and q are two distinct nodes on the unique path from x to y. \n\n2) F x y : Report the farthest two values in the unique path from x to y i.e. compute max(|Ap - Aq|) where p and q are two distinct nodes on the unique path from x to y.\n\nIt is also mentioned that x is not equal to y in any query and that no two nodes have the same value printed on them. Also, |x| denotes the absolute value of x. \n\nTakaki is perplexed and requires your help to solve this task? Can you help him out?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of nodes in tree T. \nThe second line comprises N space separated integers denoting A, where the i-th integer denotes Ai. \nThe next N-1 lines each comprise two space separated integers u and v, denoting that node u and node v\nare connected by an edge. It is guaranteed that the final graph will be a connected tree.\nThe next line contains a single integer Q, denoting number of queries. \nThe next Q lines comprise the queries. Each such line is of the format C x y or F x y. \n\n-----Output-----\nFor each query, print the required output as mentioned above. \n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 2 \u2264 N \u2264 35000\n- 1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 109\n- 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 35000\n- 1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 N\n- No two nodes have the same value printed on them.\n- x is not equal to y in any query.\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n\n-----Subtasks-----Subtask #1 (15 points)\n- N, Q \u2264 1000Subtask #2 (20 points)\n- Only Type F queries are present.Subtask #3 (65 points)\n- Original constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:5\n1 2 7 4 5\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n2 5\n7\nC 1 5\nF 1 5\nC 2 4\nC 1 2\nF 1 3\nF 3 4\nF 2 4\n\nOutput:1\n4\n2\n1\n6\n5\n2\n\n-----Explanation-----\nGiven below is the tree corresponding to the sample input.
