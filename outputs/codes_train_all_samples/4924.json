He needs your help!\n\nYour task is to:\n\n1) Create a ```PokeScan``` class that takes in 3 arguments: ```name```, ```level``` and ```pkmntype```.\n\n2) Create a ```info``` method for this class that returns some comments about the Pokemon, specifying it's name, an observation about the ```pkmntype``` and other about the ```level```.\n\n3) Keep in mind that he has in his possession just three Pokemons for you to test the scanning function: ```Squirtle```, ```Charmander``` and ```Bulbasaur```, of ```pkmntypes``` ```water```, ```fire``` and ```grass```, respectively.\n\n4) The ```info``` method shall return a string like this:\n```Charmander, a fiery and strong Pokemon.```\n\n5) If the Pokemon level is less than or equal to 20, it's a ```weak``` Pokemon. If greater than 20 and less than or equal to 50, it's a ```fair``` one. If greater than 50, it's a ```strong``` Pokemon.\n\n6) For the ```pkmntypes```, the observations are ```wet```, ```fiery``` and ```grassy``` Pokemon, according to each Pokemon type.\n\nIMPORTANT: The correct spelling of \"Pok\u00e9mon\" is \"Pok\u00e9mon\", with the ```\"\u00e9\"```, but to maximize the compatibility of the code I've had to write it as ```\"Pokemon\"```, without the ```\"\u00e9\"```. So, in your code, don't use  the ```\"\u00e9\"```.\ndef __init__(self, name, level, pkmntype):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
