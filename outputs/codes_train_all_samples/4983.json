dictionaries can overlap. In that case you should combine all source values in an array. Duplicate values should be preserved.\n\nHere is an example:\n```cs\nvar source1 = new Dictionary{{\"A\", 1}, {\"B\", 2}}; \nvar source2 = new Dictionary{{\"A\", 3}};\n\nDictionary result = DictionaryMerger.Merge(source1, source2);\n// result should have this content: {{\"A\", [1, 3]}, {\"B\", [2]}}\n\n```\n```python\nsource1 = {\"A\": 1, \"B\": 2} \nsource2 = {\"A\": 3}\n\nresult = merge(source1, source2);\n// result should have this content: {\"A\": [1, 3]}, \"B\": [2]}\n\n```\n\nYou can assume that only valid dictionaries are passed to your function.\nThe number of given dictionaries might be large. So take care about performance.\ndef merge(*dicts):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
