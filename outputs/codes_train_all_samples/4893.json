integers is sorted in \u201cWave\u201d order if alternate items are not less than their immediate neighbors (thus the other alternate items are not greater than their immediate neighbors).\n\nThus, the array `[4, 1, 7, 5, 6, 2, 3]` is in **Wave** order because 4 >= 1, then 1 <= 7, then 7 >= 5, then 5 <= 6, then 6 >= 2, and finally 2 <= 3.\n\nThe wave-sorted lists has to begin with an element not less than the next, so `[1, 4, 5, 3]` is not sorted in Wave because 1 < 4\n\nYour task is to implement a function that takes a list of integers and sorts it into wave order in place; your function shouldn't return anything.\n\nNote:\n- The resulting array shouldn't necessarily match anyone in the tests, a function just checks if the array is now wave sorted.\ndef wave_sort(a):\n\t\nUse
