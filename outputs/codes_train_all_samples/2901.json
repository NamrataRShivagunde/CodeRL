the usual interpretation is that bonus power points stop increasing after level 20, but for the scope of this kata, we will pretend they keep increasing as they did before.\n\nTo compute the total, you will be provided, both as non-negative integers:\n\n* class level (assume they are all psion levels and remember the base power points/day halts after level 20)\n* manifesting attribute score (Intelligence, to be more precise) to determine the total, provided the score is high enough for the character to manifest at least one power.\n\nSome examples:\n\n```python\npsion_power_points(1,0) == 0\npsion_power_points(1,10) == 0\npsion_power_points(1,11) == 2\npsion_power_points(1,20) == 4\npsion_power_points(21,30) == 448\n```\n\n*Note: I didn't explain things in detail and just pointed out to the table on purpose, as my goal is also to train the pattern recognition skills of whoever is going to take this challenges, so do not complain about a summary description.
