You have to find the length of the smallest (shortest) prefix of elements you need to erase from $a$ to make it a good array. Recall that the prefix of the array $a=[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]$ is a subarray consisting several first elements: the prefix of the array $a$ of length $k$ is the array $[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k]$ ($0 \\le k \\le n$).\n\nThe array $b$ of length $m$ is called good, if you can obtain a non-decreasing array $c$ ($c_1 \\le c_2 \\le \\dots \\le c_{m}$) from it, repeating the following operation $m$ times (initially, $c$ is empty):  select either the first or the last element of $b$, remove it from $b$, and append it to the end of the array $c$. \n\nFor example, if we do $4$ operations: take $b_1$, then $b_{m}$, then $b_{m-1}$ and at last $b_2$, then $b$ becomes $[b_3, b_4, \\dots, b_{m-3}]$ and $c =[b_1, b_{m}, b_{m-1}, b_2]$.\n\nConsider the following example: $b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 1]$. This array is good because we can obtain non-decreasing array $c$ from it by the following sequence of operations:  take the first element of $b$, so $b = [2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 1]$, $c = [1]$;  take the last element of $b$, so $b = [2, 3, 4, 4, 2]$, $c = [1, 1]$;  take the last element of $b$, so $b = [2, 3, 4, 4]$, $c = [1, 1, 2]$;  take the first element of $b$, so $b = [3, 4, 4]$, $c = [1, 1, 2, 2]$;  take the first element of $b$, so $b = [4, 4]$, $c = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]$;  take the last element of $b$, so $b = [4]$, $c = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]$;  take the only element of $b$, so $b = []$, $c = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]$\u00a0\u2014 $c$ is non-decreasing. \n\nNote that the array consisting of one element is good.\n\nPrint the length of the shortest prefix of $a$ to delete (erase), to make $a$ to be a good array. Note that the required length can be $0$.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the length of $a$. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$ ($\\sum n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer: the length of the shortest prefix of elements you need to erase from $a$ to make it a good array.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n4\n1 2 3 4\n7\n4 3 3 8 4 5 2\n3\n1 1 1\n7\n1 3 1 4 5 3 2\n5\n5 4 3 2 3\n\nOutput\n0\n4\n0\n2\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case of the example, the array $a$ is already good, so we don't need to erase any prefix.\n\nIn the second test case of the example, the initial array $a$ is not good. Let's erase first $4$ elements of $a$, the result is $[4, 5, 2]$. The resulting array is good. You can prove that if you erase fewer number of first elements, the result will not be good.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
