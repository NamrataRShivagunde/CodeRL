Continue with the next number AFTER this taken numbers.\n- If there are too few numbers to take by number, take the last available numbers.\n```\n\nThe given array will always contain numbers. There will only be numbers > 0.\n\nExample:\n```\n [1,4,5,2,1,2,4,5,2,6,2,3,3] -> [1,[4,5,2,1],2,[4,5,2,6],2,[3,3]]\n\nSteps: \n1. The 1 is added directly to the new array.\n2. The next number is 4. So the next 4 numbers (4,5,2,1) are added as sub-array in the new array.\n3. The 2 is added directly to the new array.\n4. The next number is 4. So the next 4 numbers (4,5,2,6) are added as sub-array in the new array.\n5. The 2 is added directly to the new array.\n6. The next number is 3. So the next 3 numbers would be taken. There are only 2, \n   so take these (3,3) as sub-array in the new array.\n```\n\nThere is a harder version of this kata!\nUnflatten a list (Harder than easy)\n\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\nI have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.\ndef unflatten(flat_array):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
