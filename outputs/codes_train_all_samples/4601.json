they embark on missions.\n\nEach time they go on a mission, every Mormons converts a fixed number of people (reach) into followers. This continues and every freshly converted Mormon as well as every original Mormon go on another mission and convert the same fixed number of people each. The process continues until they reach a predefined target number of followers (input into the model).\n\nConverted Mormons are unique so that there's no duplication amongst them.\n\nCreate a function Mormons(startingNumber, reach, target) that calculates how many missions Mormons need to embark on, in order to reach their target. While each correct solution will pass, for more fun try to make a recursive function.\n\nAll model inputs are valid positive integers.\ndef mormons(starting_number, reach, target):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
