group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:\n\nEvery worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.\nEvery worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.\n\nReturn the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above

quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], K = 3\nOutput: 30.66667\nExplanation: We pay 4 to 0-th worker, 13.33333 to 2-th and 3-th workers seperately. \n\n\u00a0\nNote:\n\n1 <= K <= N <= 10000,
