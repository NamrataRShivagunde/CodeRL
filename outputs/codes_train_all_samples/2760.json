Twenty of the group's volunteers assumed the licking challenge-unassisted by machinery-and averaged 252 licks each to the center.\n\nYour task, if you choose to accept it, is to write a function that will return the number of licks it took to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop, given some environmental variables.\n\nEveryone knows it's harder to lick a tootsie pop in cold weather but it's easier if the sun is out. You will be given an object of environmental conditions for each trial paired with a value that will increase or decrease the number of licks. The environmental conditions all apply to the same trial.\n\nAssuming that it would normally take 252 licks to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop, return the new total of licks along with the condition that proved to be most challenging (causing the most added licks) in that trial.\n\nExample:\n```\ntotalLicks({ \"freezing temps\": 10, \"clear skies\": -2 });\n```\nShould return:\n```\n\"It took 260 licks to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop. The toughest challenge was freezing temps.\"\n```\nOther cases:\nIf there are no challenges, the toughest challenge sentence should be omitted. If there are multiple challenges with the highest toughest amount, the first one presented will be the toughest.\nIf an environment variable is present, it will be either a positive or negative integer. No need to validate.\n\n\nCheck out my other 80's Kids Katas:\n\n\n80's Kids #1: How Many Licks Does It Take\n80's Kids #2: Help Alf Find His Spaceship\n80's Kids #3: Punky Brewster's Socks\n80's Kids #4: Legends of the Hidden Temple\n80's Kids #5: You Can't Do That on Television\n80's Kids #6: Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em Robots\n80's Kids #7: She's a Small Wonder\n80's Kids #8: The Secret World of Alex Mack\n80's Kids #9: Down in Fraggle Rock \n80's Kids #10: Captain Planet\ndef total_licks(env):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
