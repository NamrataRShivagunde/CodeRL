These activities have\nincreased multifold after the death of the bandit who used to\nlord over these jungles.  Having lost the battle to prevent the\nMafia from illegally felling the teak trees in this forest, the\ngovernment of Siruseri came up with a novel idea.  Why not\nlegalise the deforestation activity and at least make some money\nin the process? So the Government decided to lease out parts of\nthe forest to the Timber Mafia.\nMost of the teak trees in the forests of Siruseri were planted\nduring the colonial times, after the native trees had been cut.\nLike everything European, the forest is very regular and\norderly. It is rectangular in shape and the trees are arranged in\nuniformly spaced rows and coloumns.\nSince the trees differ in height and girth, the timber value\ndiffers from tree to tree.  The forest department has collected\ndata on each tree and knows the volume of wood (in cubic feet)\navailable in each tree in the forest.\nThe forest department maintains this information in the form of\nan $M \\times N$ array of integers, where the\n$(i, j)$th entry is the volume, in cubic feet, of the\n$i^{th}$ tree on the $i^{th}$ row (or, equivalently, the\n$i^{th}$ tree on the $i^{th}$ column).  We assume that\nour rows are numbered top to bottom and the columns are numbered\nfrom left to right.  For example, such an array could look like\n\nThis array tells us that  the volume of the tree at position $(3,4)$ is $15$\ncubic feet and so on.\nAny rectangular piece of land with trees at each corner can be\nleased out.  In order to fix the lease price for any rectangular\nplot of the forest the forest department needs to know the amount\nof wood available inside the plot.\nA rectangular plot is described by the positions of the trees in\nits top left corner and the bottom right corner. For example the\npositions $(2,2)$ and $(3,4)$ describes the following part\nrectangular part of the above forest.\n\nThe total amount of wood available in this rectangular plot is $76$\ncubic feet.  Similarly $(4,2)$ and $(4,2)$ describes the rectangle\nwith just one tree and its volume is $20$ cubic feet.\nYour task is to write a program that helps the forest department\nto compute the total volume of the trees insides any specfied\nrectangular plot.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line of the input contains two integers $M$ and $N$ indicating the number of rows and columns of trees in the forest. \n- The following $M$ lines have $N$ integers each. The $j^{th}$ integer on line $i+1$ denotes the volume (in cubic feet) of the $j^{th}$  tree on the $i^{th}$  row. \n- Line $M+2$ contains a single integer $C$ indicating the number of rectangles for which the total volume is to be computed. \n- Each of the following $C$ lines (line $M+2+1 ... M+2+C$) contain four integers $x_1, y_1, x_2$ and $y_2$ (with $x_1 \\leq x_2$ and $y_1 \\leq y_2$) and describes a rectangle. The rectangle has its top left corner at the tree in position $(x_1,y_1)$ and its bottom right corner at the tree at position $(x_2,y_2)$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nYour output must contain $C$ lines with one integer on each line. Line $i$ must contain the total volume of wood in the rectangle described on line $M+2+i$ in the input.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- In $30 \\%$ of inputs, $1 \\leq C \\leq 100$.\n- In all inputs, $2 \\leq N, M \\leq 1000$ and $1 \\leq C \\leq 1000000$\n- $0 \\leq$ volume of wood in each tree $\\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq x_1 \\leq x_2 \\leq M$\n- $1 \\leq y_1 \\leq y_2 \\leq N$\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4 4 \n3 4 15 23 \n14 20 12 9\n3 8 12 15\n12 20 7 5\n2\n2 2 3 4 \n4 2 4 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n76\n20\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
