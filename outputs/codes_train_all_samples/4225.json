The magician has one ball and three cups, he shows Ronny which cup he hides the ball under (b), he then mixes all the cups around by performing multiple two-cup switches (arr). Ronny can record the switches but can't work out where the ball is. Write a programme to help him do this. \n\nRules: \n- There will only ever be three cups.\n- Only two cups will be swapped at a time. \n- The cups and their switches will be refered to by their index in a row of three, beginning at one. So [[1,2]] means the cup at position one, is swapped with the cup at position two. \n- Arr will be an array of integers 1 - 3 organised in pairs. \n- There won't be any empty sub-arrays.\n- If arr is just an empty array b should be returned.\n\nExamples: \n\n(b) = 2, \n(arr) = [[1,2]]\n\nThe ball is under cup number : 1\n\n-------\n\n(b) = 1, \n(arr) = [[2,3],[1,2],[1,2]]\n\nThe ball is under cup number : 1\n\n-------\n\n(b) = 2, \n(arr) = [[1,3],[1,2],[2,1],[2,3]]\n\nThe ball is under cup number : 3\ndef cup_and_balls(b, arr):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
