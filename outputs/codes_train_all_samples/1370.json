were strolling outside the restaurant at the end of the universe. On a metaspiral path you stumble upon a weird device which takes a three-digit number as input and processes it. The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy explains that it processes the input in the following manner: \n- Multiplies it with 13, followed by 11 and then 7          \n- Outputs all the distinct three-digit numbers possible from the digits of the new number (each digit can only be used once)          \nYour friend Zaphod is in a playful mood, and does the following with the device-           \n- Given a three-digit positive number $K$, he feeds it to the device for processing.          \n- He then takes the numbers it gives as output, and send each of them through the device and again collect all the numbers sent out.          \n- Repeats the above step $N$ times.          \nTo test your wit, he challenges you to find the number of distinct 3-digit numbers which the device outputs over the $N$ steps. Can you?\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\n- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers $K, N$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase, output a single integer denoting the number of distinct 3-digit numbers which the device outputs over the $N$ steps.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$ \n- $5 \\leq N \\leq 10^9$ \n- Each digit of $K$ is non-zero           \n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n\n123 5         \n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n27\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
