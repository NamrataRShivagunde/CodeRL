We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts\u00a0can be different for different buildings). Height\u00a00 is considered to be a\u00a0building\u00a0as well.\u00a0\nAt the end, the \"skyline\" when viewed from all four directions\u00a0of the grid, i.e.\u00a0top, bottom, left, and right,\u00a0must be the same as the\u00a0skyline of the original grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance. See\u00a0the following example.\nWhat is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?\nExample:\nInput: grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]\nOutput: 35\nExplanation: \nThe grid is:\n[ [3, 0, 8, 4], \n  [2, 4, 5, 7],\n  [9, 2, 6, 3],\n  [0, 3, 1, 0] ]\n\nThe skyline viewed from top or bottom is: [9, 4, 8, 7]\nThe skyline viewed from left or right is: [8, 7, 9, 3]\n\nThe grid after increasing the height of buildings without affecting skylines is:\n\ngridNew = [ [8, 4, 8, 7],\n            [7, 4, 7, 7],\n            [9, 4, 8, 7],\n            [3, 3, 3, 3] ]\n\n\nNotes: \n\n1 < grid.length = grid[0].length <= 50.\nAll heights grid[i][j] are in the range [0, 100].\nAll buildings in grid[i][j] occupy the entire grid cell: that is, they are a 1 x 1 x grid[i][j] rectangular prism.\nclass Solution:\n    def maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
