He travels every morning to meet his friend Ms. Y walking a predefined path.\n\nTo cut the distance short, one day he decides to construct a skywalk from his place to his friend\u2019s place. Help him to find the shortest distance between the two residences.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single positive integer T <= 100, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a string which is the path from X to Y. The integer value represents the distance. The character R or L represents a Right or a Left respectively.\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum distance and the direction(N,S,W,E,NE,NW,SE,SW) of Y\u2019s residence with respect to X\u2019s residence. The output distance should have only 1 decimal place with no approximation.
