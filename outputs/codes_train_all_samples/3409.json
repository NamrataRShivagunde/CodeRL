Unfortunately, fish are often seen as high maintenance. Contrary to popular belief, fish actually reduce pond maintenance as they graze on string algae and bottom feed from the pond floor. They also make very enjoyable pets, providing hours of natural entertainment.\n\n\n\n# Task\n\n\nIn this Kata you are fish in a pond that needs to survive by eating other fish. You can only eat fish that are the same size or smaller than yourself. \nYou must create a function called fish that takes a shoal of fish as an input string. From this you must work out how many fish you can eat and ultimately the size you will grow to.\n\n\n# Rules\n\n1.\u00a0 Your size starts at 1\n\n2.\u00a0 The shoal string will contain fish integers between 0-9\n\n3.\u00a0 0 = algae and wont help you feed.\n\n4.\u00a0 The fish integer represents the size of the fish (1-9).\n\n5.\u00a0 You can only eat fish the same size or less than yourself.\n\n6.\u00a0 You can eat the fish in any order you choose to maximize your size.\n\n7 \u00a0 You can and only eat each fish once.\n\n8.\u00a0 The bigger fish you eat, the faster you grow. A size 2 fish equals two size 1 fish, size 3 fish equals three size 1 fish, and so on.\n\n9.\u00a0 Your size increments by one each time you reach the amounts below.\n\n\n# Increase your size\nYour size will increase depending how many fish you eat and on the size of the fish.\nThis chart shows the amount of size 1 fish you have to eat in order to increase your size.\n\n\n\n\nCurrent size\nAmount extra needed for next size\nTotal size 1 fish\nIncrease to size\n\n\n1\n4\n4\n2\n\n\n2\n8\n12\n3\n\n\n3\n12\n24\n4\n\n\n4\n16\n40\n5\n\n\n5\n20\n60\n6\n\n\n6\n24\n84\n7\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nPlease note: The chart represents fish of size 1\n\n# Returns\n\nReturn an integer of the maximum size you could be.\n\n\n# Example 1\nYou eat the 4 fish of size 1 (4 * 1 = 4) which increases your size to 2\nNow that you are size 2 you can eat the fish that are sized 1 or 2.\nYou then eat the 4 fish of size 2 (4 * 2 = 8) which increases your size to 3\n\n\n\n```python\nfish(\"11112222\") => 3\n```\n\n# Example 2\n\nYou eat the 4 fish of size 1 (4 * 1 = 4) which increases your size to 2\nYou then eat the remainding 8 fish of size 1 (8 * 1 = 8) which increases your size to 3\n\n```python\nfish(\"111111111111\") => 3\n```\n\nGood luck and enjoy!\n\n# Kata Series\nIf you enjoyed this, then please try one of my other Katas.
