distinct letter sequences ,a distinct letter sequence is defined by a sequence of small case english alphabets such that no character appears more then once.\nBut however there are two phrases that she doesn't like these phrases are \"kar\" and \"shi\" and she is given a sequence of distinct characters and she wonders how many such sequences she can form using all the characters such that these phrases don't occur.\nHelp her finding the number of such sequences.\nNew Year Gift - It is guaranteed that for sequences of length greater then 6 letters k,a,r,s,h,i will be present(we thought of being generous, thank us later :)).\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Each line consists of a string $S$ (3<=s.length<=18) of distinct characters.\n\n-----Output:-----\nPrint the number of sequences that can be formed by permuting all the characters such that phrases \"kar\" and \"shi\" don't occur.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $3 \\leq S.length \\leq 18$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\nkarp\nabcd\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n22\n24\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
