In the blink of an eye, they can now detect if a string is a first name, no matter if it is a one-word name or an hyphenated name. They're given this documentation with the algorithm: \n\n*In France, you'll often find people with hyphenated first names. They're called \"pr\u00e9noms compos\u00e9s\".\nThere could be two, or even more words linked to form a new name, quite like jQuery function chaining ;). \nThey're linked using the - symbol, like Marie-Joelle, Jean-Michel, Jean-Mouloud. \nThanks to this algorithm, you can now recognize hyphenated names quicker than Flash !* \n(yeah, their employees know how to use jQuery. Don't ask me why)\n\n\nYour mission if you accept it, recreate the algorithm.\nUsing the function **showMe**, which takes a **yourID** argument, you will check if the given argument is a name or not, by returning true or false. \n\n*Note that*\n\n- String will either be a one-word first name, or an hyphenated first name , its words being linked by \"-\". \n- Words can only start with an uppercase letter, and then lowercase letters (from a to z)\n\n\nNow is your time to help the guards !\ndef show_me(name):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
