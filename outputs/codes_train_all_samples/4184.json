{"4184": {"code": [], "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nAs most of you might know already, a prime number is an integer `n` with the following properties:\n\n* it must be greater than 1\n* it must be divisible only by itself and 1\n\nAnd that's it: -15 or 8 are not primes, 5 or 97 are; pretty easy, isn't it?\n\nWell, turns out that primes are not just a mere mathematical curiosity and are very important, for example, to allow a lot of cryptographic algorithms.\n\nBeing able to tell if a number is a prime or not is thus not such a trivial matter and doing it with some efficient algo is thus crucial.\n\nThere are already more or less efficient (or sloppy) katas asking you to find primes, but here I try to be even more zealous than other authors.\n\nYou will be given a preset array/list with the first few `primes`. And you must write a function that checks if a given number `n` is a prime looping through it and, possibly, expanding the array/list of known primes only if/when necessary (ie: as soon as you check for a **potential prime which is greater than a given threshold for each** `n`, stop).\n\n#  Memoization\n\nStoring precomputed results for later re-use is a very popular programming technique that you would better master soon and that is called [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization); while you have your wiki open, you might also wish to get some info about the [sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) (one of the few good things I learnt as extra-curricular activity in middle grade) and, to be even more efficient, you might wish to consider [an interesting reading on searching from prime from a friend of mine](https://medium.com/@lcthornhill/why-does-the-6-iteration-method-work-for-testing-prime-numbers-ba6176f58082#.dppj0il3a) [she thought about an explanation all on her own after an evening event in which I discussed primality tests with my guys].\n\nYes, you will be checked even on that part. And you better be **very** efficient in your code if you hope to pass all the tests ;)\n\n**Dedicated to my trainees that worked hard to improve their skills even on a holiday: good work guys!**\n\n**Or should I say \"girls\" ;)?
