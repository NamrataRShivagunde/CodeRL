If you can make the distance, the function will check every 100 km and produce an array with [1:kilometers already driven. 2: kilometers till end. 3: remaining amount of petrol] and return all the arrays inside another array ([[after 100km], [after 200km], [after 300km]...])\n\nPLEASE NOTE: any of the values with decimals that you return should be rounded to 2 decimals.\ndef total_kilometers(cons, petrol):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
