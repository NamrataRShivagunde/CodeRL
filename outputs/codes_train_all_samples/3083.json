(Well it's interesting to me, so there!)\n\n### Polydivisib... huh what?\n\nSo what are they?\n\nA polydivisible number is divisible in an unusual way. The first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by `2`, the first three by `3`, and so on.\n\n### Examples\n\nLet's take the number `1232` as an example.\n```\n1     / 1 = 1     // Works\n12    / 2 = 6     // Works\n123   / 3 = 41    // Works\n1232  / 4 = 308   // Works\n```\n`1232` is a polydivisible number.\n\n\nHowever, let's take the number `123220` and see what happens.\n```\n 1      /1 = 1    // Works\n 12     /2 = 6    // Works\n 123    /3 = 41   // Works\n 1232   /4 = 308  // Works\n 12322  /5 = 2464.4         // Doesn't work\n 123220 /6 = 220536.333...  // Doesn't work\n```\n`123220` is not polydivisible.\n\n### Your job: check if a number is polydivisible or not.\n\nReturn `true` if it is, and `false` if it isn't.\n\nNote: All inputs will be valid numbers between `0` and `2^53-1 (9,007,199,254,740,991)` (inclusive).   \nNote: All single digit numbers (including `0`) are trivially polydivisible.\nNote: Except for `0`, no numbers will start with `0`.\ndef polydivisible(x):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
