Let's call '3' a \"1-sum\" prime\n- For 37, we take numbers in groups of threes from the right and check if the sum of these groups is divisible by 37. \n  Example: 37 * 123456787 = 4567901119 => 4 + 567 + 901 + 119 = 1591 = 37 * 43. Let's call this a \"3-sum\" prime because we use groups of 3.\n- For 41, we take numbers in groups of fives from the right and check if the sum of these groups is divisible by 41. This is a \"5-sum\" prime.\n- Other examples: 239 is a \"7-sum\" prime (groups of 7), while 199 is a \"99-sum\" prime (groups of 99).\n\nLet's look at another type of prime:\n- For 11, we need to add all digits by alternating their signs from the right. \n  Example: 11 * 123456 = 1358016 => 6-1+0-8+5-3+1 = 0, which is divible by 11. Let's call this a \"1-altsum\" prime\n- For 7, we need to group the digits into threes from the right and add all groups by alternating their signs.\n  Example: 7 * 1234567891234 = 8641975238638 => 638 - 238 + 975 - 641 + 8 = 742/7 = 106. \n- 7 is a \"3-altsum\" prime because we use groups of threes. 47 is a \"23-altsum\" (groups of 23), while 73 is a \"4-altsum\" prime (groups of 4).\n\n\nYou will be given a prime number `p` and your task is to find the smallest positive integer `n` such that `p\u2019s` divisibility testing is `n-sum` or `n-altsum`.\n\nFor example:\n```\nsolve(3) = \"1-sum\"\nsolve(7) = \"3-altsum\"\n```\nPrimes will not exceed `50,000,000`. More examples in test cases. \n\nYou can get some insight from [Fermat's little theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem). \n\nGood luck!\ndef solve(p):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
