nums[i] \u2260 nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.\n\nThe array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.\n\nYou may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -\u221e.\n\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]\nOutput: 1 or 5 \nExplanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, \n\u00a0            or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.\n\n\nNote:\n\nYour solution should be in logarithmic complexity.\nclass Solution:\n    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
