You will be given a `list` (`lst`) of climbing grades and you have to write a function (`sort_grades`) to `return` a `list` of the grades sorted easiest to hardest.\n\nIf the input is an empty `list`, `return` an empty `list`; otherwise the input will always be a valid `list` of one or more grades.\n\nPlease do vote, rank, and provide any feedback on the kata.\ndef sort_grades(lst):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
