The string to encrypt/decrypt\n2. The Qwerty-Encryption-Key (000-999) \n```\n\nThe rules are very easy:\n```\nThe crypting-regions are these 3 lines from your keyboard:\n1. \"qwertyuiop\"\n2. \"asdfghjkl\"\n3. \"zxcvbnm,.\"\n\nIf a char of the string is not in any of these regions, take the char direct in the output.\nIf a char of the string is in one of these regions: Move it by the part of the key in the \nregion and take this char at the position from the region. \nIf the movement is over the length of the region, continue at the beginning.\nThe encrypted char must have the same case like the decrypted char! \nSo for upperCase-chars the regions are the same, but with pressed \"SHIFT\"!\n\nThe Encryption-Key is an integer number from 000 to 999. E.g.: 127\n\nThe first digit of the key (e.g. 1) is the movement for the first line.\nThe second digit of the key (e.g. 2) is the movement for the second line.\nThe third digit of the key (e.g. 7) is the movement for the third line.\n\n(Consider that the key is an integer! When you got a 0 this would mean 000. A 1 would mean 001. And so on.)\n```\n\nYou do not need to do any prechecks. The strings will always be not null \nand will always have a length > 0. You do not have to throw any exceptions.\n\nAn Example:\n```\nEncrypt \"Ball\" with key 134\n1. \"B\" is in the third region line. Move per 4 places in the region. -> \">\" (Also \"upperCase\"!)\n2. \"a\" is in the second region line. Move per 3 places in the region. -> \"f\"\n3. \"l\" is in the second region line. Move per 3 places in the region. -> \"d\"\n4. \"l\" is in the second region line. Move per 3 places in the region. -> \"d\"\n--> Output would be \">fdd\"\n```\n\n*Hint: Don't forget: The regions are from an US-Keyboard!*\n*In doubt google for \"US Keyboard.\"*\n\n\n\nThis kata is part of the Simple Encryption Series:\nSimple Encryption #1 - Alternating Split\nSimple Encryption #2 - Index-Difference\nSimple Encryption #3 - Turn The Bits Around\nSimple Encryption #4 - Qwerty\n\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)\ndef encrypt(text, encryptKey):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
