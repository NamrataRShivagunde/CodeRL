by **at least** one place and **at most** two places from the colours of the mother magpie.\n\nSo now you can work out if any two magpies may be related. \n\n*...and Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle the magpies said*\n\n# Kata Task\n\nGiven the colours of two magpies, determine if one is a possible **child** or **grand-child** of the other.\n\n\n# Notes\n\n* Each pair of birds being compared will have same number of colour areas\n* `B` = Black\n* `W` = White\n\n# Example\n\nGiven these three magpies\n\n\nMagpie 1  BWBWBW\nMagpie 2  BWBWBB\nMagpie 3  WWWWBB\n\n\nYou can see:\n* Magpie 2 may be a child of Magpie 1 because there is only one difference\n* Magpie 3 may be child of Magpie 2 because there are two differences\n* So Magpie 3 may be a grand-child of Magpie 1\n* On the other hand, Magpie 3 cannot be a child of Magpie 1 because there are three differences\n\n\n---\n\nDM :-)\n\n\n^ *This fact is little known because I just made it up*\ndef child(bird1, bird2):\n\t\nUse Call-Based
