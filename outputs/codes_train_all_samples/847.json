Having read this fact on internet, two chefs from the Elephant city, Arjuna and Bhima are set to make pizza popular in India. They organized a social awareness camp, where N people ( other than these two ) sit around a large pizza. To make it more interesting, they make some pairs among these N people and the two persons in a pair, feed each other.\n\nEach person should be a part of at most one pair and most importantly, to make feeding easy, any two pairs should not cross each other ( see figure for more clarity ). Arjuna and Bhima decided to play a game on making the pairs. In his turn, a player makes a pair ( selects two persons, as long as its valid ) and this pair start feeding each other. Arjuna and Bhima take turns alternately, by making a pair in each turn, and they  play optimally ( see Notes for more clarity ). The one who can not make a pair in his turn, loses. Given N, find who wins the game, if Arjuna starts first. \n\n-----Notes-----\n- 'Optimally' means, if there is a possible move a person can take in his turn that can make him win finally, he will always take that. You can assume both are very intelligent. \n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line contains an integer T ( number of test cases, around 1000 ). Each of the next T lines contains an integer N ( 2 <= N <= 10000 )\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output the name of the winner ( either \"Arjuna\" or \"Bhima\" ( without quotes ) ) in a new line.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n4\n2\n4\n5\n6\n\nOutput:\nArjuna\nArjuna\nBhima\nArjuna\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet the people around the table are numbered 1, 2, ... , N in clock-wise order as shown in the image \n\nCase 1 : N = 2. Only two persons and Arjuna makes the only possible pair (1,2)\n\nCase 2 : N = 4. Arjuna can make the pair (1,3). Bhima can not make any more pairs ( without crossing the pair (1,3) )\n\nCase 3 : N = 5. No matter which pair Arjuna makes first, Bhima can always make one more pair, and Arjuna can not make any further\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
