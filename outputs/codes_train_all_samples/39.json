There are $n$ crossroads in the line in the town, and there is either the bus or the tram station at each crossroad.\n\nThe crossroads are represented as a string $s$ of length $n$, where $s_i = \\texttt{A}$, if there is a bus station at $i$-th crossroad, and $s_i = \\texttt{B}$, if there is a tram station at $i$-th crossroad. Currently Petya is at the first crossroad (which corresponds to $s_1$) and his goal is to get to the last crossroad (which corresponds to $s_n$).\n\nIf for two crossroads $i$ and $j$ for all crossroads $i, i+1, \\ldots, j-1$ there is a bus station, one can pay $a$ roubles for the bus ticket, and go from $i$-th crossroad to the $j$-th crossroad by the bus (it is not necessary to have a bus station at the $j$-th crossroad). Formally, paying $a$ roubles Petya can go from $i$ to $j$ if $s_t = \\texttt{A}$ for all $i \\le t < j$. \n\nIf for two crossroads $i$ and $j$ for all crossroads $i, i+1, \\ldots, j-1$ there is a tram station, one can pay $b$ roubles for the tram ticket, and go from $i$-th crossroad to the $j$-th crossroad by the tram (it is not necessary to have a tram station at the $j$-th crossroad). Formally, paying $b$ roubles Petya can go from $i$ to $j$ if $s_t = \\texttt{B}$ for all $i \\le t < j$.\n\nFor example, if $s$=\"AABBBAB\", $a=4$ and $b=3$ then Petya needs:[Image]  buy one bus ticket to get from $1$ to $3$,  buy one tram ticket to get from $3$ to $6$,  buy one bus ticket to get from $6$ to $7$. \n\nThus, in total he needs to spend $4+3+4=11$ roubles. Please note that the type of the stop at the last crossroad (i.e. the character $s_n$) does not affect the final expense.\n\nNow Petya is at the first crossroad, and he wants to get to the $n$-th crossroad. After the party he has left with $p$ roubles. He's decided to go to some station on foot, and then go to home using only public transport.\n\nHelp him to choose the closest crossroad $i$ to go on foot the first, so he has enough money to get from the $i$-th crossroad to the $n$-th, using only tram and bus tickets.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$).\n\nThe first line of each test case consists of three integers $a, b, p$ ($1 \\le a, b, p \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the cost of bus ticket, the cost of tram ticket and the amount of money Petya has.\n\nThe second line of each test case consists of one string $s$, where $s_i = \\texttt{A}$, if there is a bus station at $i$-th crossroad, and $s_i = \\texttt{B}$, if there is a tram station at $i$-th crossroad ($2 \\le |s| \\le 10^5$).\n\nIt is guaranteed, that the sum of the length of strings $s$ by all test cases in one test doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print one number\u00a0\u2014 the minimal index $i$ of a crossroad Petya should go on foot. The rest of the path (i.e. from $i$ to $n$ he should use public transport).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n2 2 1\nBB\n1 1 1\nAB\n3 2 8\nAABBBBAABB\n5 3 4\nBBBBB\n2 1 1\nABABAB\n\nOutput\n2\n1\n3\n1\n6\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
