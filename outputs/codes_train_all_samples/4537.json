encoding where transitions between consecutive numbers differ by only one bit. This is a useful encoding for reducing hardware data hazards with values that change rapidly and/or connect to slower hardware as inputs. It is also useful for generating inputs for Karnaugh maps.\n\nHere is an exemple of what the code look like:\n\n```\n0:    0000\n1:    0001\n2:    0011\n3:    0010\n4:    0110\n5:    0111\n6:    0101\n7:    0100\n8:    1100\n```\n\nThe goal of this kata is to build two function bin2gray and gray2bin wich will convert natural binary to Gray Code and vice-versa. We will use the \"binary reflected Gray code\". The input and output will be arrays of 0 and 1, MSB at index 0.\n\nThere are \"simple\" formula to implement these functions. It is a very interesting exercise to find them by yourself.\n\nAll input will be correct binary arrays.\ndef bin2gray(bits):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
