One of the most common ways to represent logical reasonings is with **propositional logic**.\n\nA propositional formula is no more than what you normally use in your *if statements*, but without functions or predicates. The basic unit for these formulas are **literals**. Let's see some examples:\n\n```\nf = p \u2227 q\n```\n\nHere ```p``` and ```q``` would be the literals. This formula means that *f* evaluates to ```True``` only when both ```p``` **and** ```q``` are True too. The ```\u2227``` operator is formally called **conjunction** and is often called **and**.\n\n```\nf = p \u2228 q\n```\n\nThis formula means that *f* evaluates to ```True``` only when any of ```p``` **or** ```q``` are  True. This includes the case when both are True. The ```\u2228``` operator is formally called **disjunction** and is often called **or**.\n\n```\nf = \u00acp\n```\n\nThe ```\u00ac``` operator is analogous to the **not** operation. it evaluates to True only when its argument evaluates to False.\n\nNormally, there are also two other operators called **implication** and **biconditional**, but we will ignore them for this kata (they can be expressed in terms of the other three anyways).\n\nOnce we know this, can construct what is called an **interpretation** in order to evaluate a propositional formula. This is a fancy name for any structure that tells us which literals are False and which ones are True. Normally, interpretations are given as a set:\n\n```python\np = Literal('p')\nq = Literal('q')\nr = Literal('r')\n\nf = p \u2228 q \u2228 \u00acr\n\ni_1 = {p, q} # p and q are True, r is False\ni_2 = {r}    # r is True, p and q are False\ni_3 = {}     # p, q and r are False\n\n# Note: the 'evaluate' function is not given\nevaluate(f, i_1) == True\nevaluate(f, i_2) == False\nevaluate(f, i_3) == True\n```\n\nAs you can see, if the literal is in the set, we say it evaluates to True, else it is False.\n\nAs a final note, an interpretation that makes a formula True is called a **model** when all the literals in the set appear in the formula.\n\n# The SAT problem\n\nThis is a famous NP problem that is stated as follows:\n\n> Given a propositional formula *F*, does it exist an interpretation such that it evaluates to True? (i.e. is *F* **satisfiable**?)\n\nNumerous algorithms exist for this purpose, and your task is to program one of them. Right now, you are not supposed to program an efficient algorithm, but I may create a performance version if this kata gets good reception :)\n\n# Specification\n\nProgram a ```sat(f: Formula)``` function that returns the following:\n- ```False``` if ```f``` is not satisfiable.\n- An interpretation that makes ```f``` evaluate to True in the case that it is satisfiable.\n\n# Preloaded code\n\nYou are given a class ```Formula``` that has the following members:\n\n- ```args```: arguments of the operation if the formula is not a literal (children nodes of the formula's tree). They are given as a list of Formula objects that has one element in the case of the negation operator and two or more elements in the case of the conjunction and disjunction operators.\n- ```is_literal()```: True if the formula is a literal (i.e. not an operation).\n- ```is_and()```: True if the formula is a **conjunction**.\n- ```is_or()```: True if the formula is a **disjunction**. \n- ```is_not()```: True if the formula is a **negation**. \n\nYou are also given a class ```Literal``` that extends from ```Formula``` and has the following members:\n\n- ```name```: string that represents the literal. Two literals with the same name **are the same literal**.\n*Note: the rest of members are not guaranteed in the case of a literal*\n\nThe ```&``` operator is overloaded as the conjunction, ```|``` as the disjunction and ```~``` as the negation. Also, a ```__repr__``` function is given for debugging purposes.\n\n# Extra examples\n\n```\nf = \u00ac(p \u2228 q) # Satisfiable with {}\n```\n```\nf = \u00ac(p \u2227 q) # Satisfiable with {p}, {q} and {}\n```\n```\nf = p \u2227 (q \u2228 r) # Satisfiable with {p, q}, {p, r} and {p, q, r}\n```\n```\nf = \u00acp \u2228 \u00acq # Satisfiable with {p}, {q} and {} (See De Morgan's Laws)\n```\n```\nf = p \u2227 \u00acp # Not satisfiable\n```\ndef sat(f:\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
