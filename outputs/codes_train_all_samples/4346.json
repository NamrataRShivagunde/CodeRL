The article is not complete without this word. Maya has a friend, Dan, and he is very good with words, but he doesn't like to just give them away. He texts Maya a number and she needs to find out the hidden word. \nThe words can contain only the letter: \"a\", \"b\", \"d\", \"e\", \"i\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"o\", and \"t\".\n\nLuckily, Maya has the key:\n\n\"a\" - 6\n\"b\" - 1 \n\"d\" - 7\n\"e\" - 4\n\"i\" - 3\n\"l\" - 2\n\"m\" - 9\n\"n\" - 8\n\"o\" - 0\n\"t\" - 5\n\nYou can help Maya by writing a function that will take a number between 100 and 999999 and return a string with the word. \n\nThe input is always a number, contains only the numbers in the key. \nThe output should be always a string with one word, all lowercase.\n\nMaya won't forget to thank you at the end of her article :)\ndef hidden(num):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
