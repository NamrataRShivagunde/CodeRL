But his program can store only integers. Being a newbie, he didn't know about rounding the numbers. Hence his program returns the absolute value of the result if possible. For example, sqrt(3) = 1.73205080757\u2026\u2026. His program will return 1\nGiven a number $N$, and it's integral square root $S$, His instructor will consider the answer correct if Difference between $N$ and the square of $S$ is within less than or equal to $X$% of $N$.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line contains $T$ no. of test cases and $X$ separated by space\n- For every test case, a line contains an integer $N$\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor every test case, print yes  if his programs return square root and (N-(S^2)) <= 0.01XN .
