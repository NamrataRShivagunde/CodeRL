If you haven't said anything you shouldn't have, the bucket should be filled with \"air\". The words should be tested regardless of case.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nCheck out my other 80's Kids Katas:\n\n\n80's Kids #1: How Many Licks Does It Take\n80's Kids #2: Help Alf Find His Spaceship\n80's Kids #3: Punky Brewster's Socks\n80's Kids #4: Legends of the Hidden Temple\n80's Kids #5: You Can't Do That on Television\n80's Kids #6: Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em Robots\n80's Kids #7: She's a Small Wonder\n80's Kids #8: The Secret World of Alex Mack\n80's Kids #9: Down in Fraggle Rock \n80's Kids #10: Captain Planet\ndef bucket_of(said):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
