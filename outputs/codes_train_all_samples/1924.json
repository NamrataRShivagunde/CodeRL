occurs within a difference of 60 minutes, have the same name and is in a different city. Similarly the second one is invalid too.\nExample 2:\nInput: transactions = [\"alice,20,800,mtv\",\"alice,50,1200,mtv\"]\nOutput: [\"alice,50,1200,mtv\"]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: transactions = [\"alice,20,800,mtv\",\"bob,50,1200,mtv\"]\nOutput: [\"bob,50,1200,mtv\"]\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\ntransactions.length <= 1000\nEach transactions[i] takes the form \"{name},{time},{amount},{city}\"\nEach {name} and {city}\u00a0consist of\u00a0lowercase English letters, and have lengths between 1 and 10.\nEach {time} consist of\u00a0digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 1000.\nEach {amount}\u00a0consist of\u00a0digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 2000.\nclass Solution:\n    def invalidTransactions(self, transactions: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
