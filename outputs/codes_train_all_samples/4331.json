With Python 2.7.6, when writing your solution you can just copy the above umlaut-letters (instead of the unicode sequences) and paste them into your code, but I haven't found something yet that will work for *both* 2.7.6 and 3.4.3 -- hopefully I will find something soon (answers/suggestions are welcome!), and hopefully that part will also be easier with other languages when I add them.\n\nSecond, along the same lines, don't bother trying to use string translate() and maketrans() to solve this in Python 2.7.6, because maketrans will see the character-mapping strings as being different lengths. Use a different approach instead.\ndef heavy_metal_umlauts(boring_text):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
