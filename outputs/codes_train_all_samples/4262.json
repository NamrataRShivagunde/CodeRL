To make paying quick and easy she uses a simple mental algorithm she's called The Fair %20 Rule. She's gotten so good she can do this in a few seconds and it always impresses her dates but she's perplexingly still single. Like you probably. \n\nThis is how she does it:\n\n - She rounds the price `P` at the tens place e.g:\n   - 25 becomes 30\n   - 24 becomes 20\n   - 5 becomes 10\n   - 4 becomes 0\n - She figures out the base tip `T` by dropping the singles place digit e.g:\n   - when `P = 24` she rounds to 20 drops 0 `T = 2`\n   - `P = 115` rounds to 120 drops 0 `T = 12`\n   - `P = 25` rounds to 30 drops 0 `T = 3`\n   - `P = 5` rounds to 10 drops 0 `T = 1`\n   - `P = 4` rounds to 0 `T = 0`\n - She then applies a 3 point satisfaction rating `R` to `T` i.e:\n   - When she's satisfied: `R = 1` and she'll add 1 to `T`\n   - Unsatisfied: `R = 0` and she'll subtract 1 from `T`\n   - Appalled: `R = -1` she'll divide `T` by 2, **rounds down** and subtracts 1\n \n## Your Task\n\nImplement a method `calc_tip` that takes two integer arguments for price `p` \n\nwhere `1 <= p <= 1000` and a rating `r` which is one of `-1, 0, 1`.\n\nThe return value `T` should be a non negative integer.\n\n*Note: each step should be done in the order listed.*\n\nDee always politely smiles and says \"Thank you\" on her way out. Dee is nice. Be like Dee.\ndef calc_tip(p, r):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
