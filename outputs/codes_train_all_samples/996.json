Well, there is more to it, but for our\npurposes this is sufficient.\nThe game consists of several rounds and in each round both players\nobtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds\nhave been played, the total score of each player is determined by\nadding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher\ntotal score is declared the winner.\nThe Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where\nthe top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager\nof Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by\nchanging the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the\nend of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once\nall the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the\nend of any round in the game is declared the winner.\n\nConsider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:\nRoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890\n\nThe total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after\neach round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23\nNote that the above table contains the cumulative scores.\nThe winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58\nat the end of round 1) during the game.\nYour task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning\nlead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will\nalways be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.\nInput\nThe first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N\n\u2264 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines\n2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.\nLine i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1\nand 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 \u2264 Si \u2264\n1000 and 1 \u2264 Ti \u2264 1000.  \nOutput\nYour output must consist of a single line containing two integers\nW and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the\nmaximum lead attained by the winner.\nExample\nInput:\n5\n140 82\n89 134\n90 110\n112 106\n88 90\n\nOutput:\n1 58\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
