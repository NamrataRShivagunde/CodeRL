So he decided to divide them into several groups called doggo communities. Let the total no. of groups be $K$ . In a community, paths between pairs of houses can be made so that doggo can play with each other. But there cannot be a path between two houses of different communities for sure. Chef wanted to make maximum no. of paths such that the total path is not greater then $K$.\nLet\u2019s visualize this problem in an engineer's way :)\nThe problem is to design a graph with max edge possible such that the total no. of edges should not be greater than the total no. of connected components.\n\n-----INPUT FORMAT-----\n- First line of each test case file contain $T$ , denoting total number of test cases.\n- $ith$ test case contain only one line with a single integer $N$ , denoting the number of dogs(vertex)\n\n-----OUTPUT FORMAT-----\n- For each test case print a line with a integer , denoting the maximum possible path possible.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^9$ \n\n-----Sub-Tasks-----\n- $20 Points$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^6$ \n\n-----Sample Input-----\n1\n\n4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2\n\n-----Explanation-----\n4 houses can be made with  like this:\n\ncommunity #1  : [1 - 2  ]\n\ncommunity #2 :  [3 - 4 ]\n\nor  [1 - 2 - 3]  , [ 4 ]\n\nIn both cases the maximum possible path is 2.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
