the same in C# because, as of now, the used version is not known. \n\n```python\nconverter(13) #returns '103'\nconverter(13,3) #returns '103.010'\nconverter(-13,0,2) #returns '-1101'\n```\n\nI know most of the world uses a comma as a [decimal mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark), but as English language and culture are *de facto* the Esperanto of us coders, we will stick to our common glorious traditions and uses, adopting the trivial dot (\".\") as decimal separator; if the absolute value of the result is <1, you have of course to put one (and only one) leading 0 before the decimal separator.\n\nFinally, you may assume that decimals if provided will always be >= 0 and that no test base will be smaller than 2 (because, you know, converting to base 1 is pretty lame) or greater than 36; as usual, for digits greater than 9 you can use uppercase alphabet letter, so your base of numeration is going to be: '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.\n\nThat is my first 3-languages-kata, so I count on you all to give me extensive feedback, no matter how harsh it may sound, so to improve myself even further :)\ndef converter(n, decimals=0, base=pi):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
