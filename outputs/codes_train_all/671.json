In FFL, each team consists of exactly $15$ players: $2$ goalkeepers, $5$ defenders, $5$ midfielders and $3$ forwards. Chef has already bought $13$ players; he is only missing one defender and one forward.\nThere are $N$ available players (numbered $1$ through $N$). For each valid $i$, the $i$-th player is either a defender or a forward and has a price $P_i$. The sum of prices of all players in a team must not exceed $100$ dollars and the players Chef bought already cost him $S$ dollars.\nCan you help Chef determine if he can complete the team by buying one defender and one forward in such a way that he does not exceed the total price limit?\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $S$.\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_N$.\n- The last line contains $N$ space-separated integers. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these integers is $0$ if the $i$-th player is a defender or $1$ if the $i$-th player is a forward.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string \"yes\" if it is possible to build a complete team or \"no\" otherwise (without quotes).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 100$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 100$\n- $13 \\le S \\le 100$\n- $1 \\le P_i \\le 100$ for each valid $i$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n2\n4 90\n3 8 6 5\n0 1 1 0\n4 90\n5 7 6 5\n0 1 1 0\n\n-----Example Output-----\nyes\nno\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: If Chef buys the $1$-st and $3$-rd player, the total price of his team is $90 + 9 = 99$, which is perfectly fine. There is no other valid way to pick two players.\nExample case 2: Chef cannot buy two players in such a way that all conditions are satisfied.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
