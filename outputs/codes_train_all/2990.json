Most wouldn't. One would think you have a fifty-fifty chance of winning after having been shown a false door, however the math proves that you significantly increase your chances, from 1/3 to 2/3 by switching.\n\nFurther information about this puzzle can be found on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem.\n\nIn this program you are given an array of people who have all guessed on a door from 1-3, as well as given the door which includes the price. You need to make every person switch to the other door, and increase their chances of winning. Return the win percentage (as a rounded int) of all participants.\ndef monty_hall(correct_door_number, participant_guesses):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
