Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier \u2014 a machine which mutates minions.\n\nEach minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer. The transmogrifier adds an integer K to each of the minions' characteristic value. \n\nGru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations.\n\nGiven the initial characteristic integers of N minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.\n\n-----Input Format:-----\nThe first line contains one integer, T, which is the number of test cases. Each test case is then described in two lines.\nThe first line contains two integers N and K, as described in the statement.\nThe next line contains N integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions.\n\n-----Output Format:-----\nFor each testcase, output one integer in a new line, which is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n- 1 \u2264 K \u2264 100\n- All initial characteristic values lie between 1 and 105, both inclusive.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n1\n5 10\n2 4 1 35 1\n\nOutput:\n1\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nAfter transmogrification, the characteristic values become {12,14,11,45,11}, out of which only 14 is divisible by 7. So only the second minion becomes Wolverine-like.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
