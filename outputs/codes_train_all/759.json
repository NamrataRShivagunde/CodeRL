She thought of who can help her, and got reminded of Kabir who has good problem solving skills. The question is:\nGiven N$N$ the number of elements in the sequence A1$A_1$,A2$A_2$ \u2026 An$A_n$. Find out the prime factor which occurred maximum number of times among the largest prime factor corresponding to each element. if there are more than one such prime factors print the largest one.\nYou are friends with Kabir, help him to solve the problem for Tara.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. \n- First line of each test case contains N$N$, the number of elements in the sequence.\n- Second line contains N space separated elements A1$A_1$,A2$A_2$ \u2026 An$A_n$.\n\n-----Output:-----\n- For each test case, print a single line, the number which occurs maximum number of times from the largest prime factor corresponding to each element.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1\u2264T\u226410$1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- 1\u2264N\u2264105$1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- 2\u2264A[i]\u2264105$2 \\leq A[i] \\leq 10^5$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n7\n\n3 2 15 6 8 5 10\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n5\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nThe largest prime factors of numbers are:\n3 2  5  3  2  5  5 , of which 5 is most frequent.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
