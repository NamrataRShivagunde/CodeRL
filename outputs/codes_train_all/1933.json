string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition.\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: \"1+1i\", \"1+1i\"\nOutput: \"0+2i\"\nExplanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: \"1+-1i\", \"1+-1i\"\nOutput: \"0+-2i\"\nExplanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe input strings will not have extra blank.\nThe input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be also in this form.\nclass Solution:\n    def complexNumberMultiply(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
