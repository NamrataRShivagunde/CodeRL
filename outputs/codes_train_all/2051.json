She is responsible for creating a departure schedule. There are n flights that must depart today, the i-th of them is planned to depart at the i-th minute of the day.\n\nMetropolis airport is the main transport hub of Metropolia, so it is difficult to keep the schedule intact. This is exactly the case today: because of technical issues, no flights were able to depart during the first k minutes of the day, so now the new departure schedule must be created.\n\nAll n scheduled flights must now depart at different minutes between (k + 1)-th and (k + n)-th, inclusive. However, it's not mandatory for the flights to depart in the same order they were initially scheduled to do so\u00a0\u2014 their order in the new schedule can be different. There is only one restriction: no flight is allowed to depart earlier than it was supposed to depart in the initial schedule.\n\nHelen knows that each minute of delay of the i-th flight costs airport c_{i} burles. Help her find the order for flights to depart in the new schedule that minimizes the total cost for the airport.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 300 000), here n is the number of flights, and k is the number of minutes in the beginning of the day that the flights did not depart.\n\nThe second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 10^7), here c_{i} is the cost of delaying the i-th flight for one minute.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first line must contain the minimum possible total cost of delaying the flights.\n\nThe second line must contain n different integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} (k + 1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 k + n), here t_{i} is the minute when the i-th flight must depart. If there are several optimal schedules, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5 2\n4 2 1 10 2\n\nOutput\n20\n3 6 7 4 5 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet us consider sample test. If Helen just moves all flights 2 minutes later preserving the order, the total cost of delaying the flights would be (3 - 1)\u00b74 + (4 - 2)\u00b72 + (5 - 3)\u00b71 + (6 - 4)\u00b710 + (7 - 5)\u00b72 = 38 burles. \n\nHowever, the better schedule is shown in the sample answer, its cost is (3 - 1)\u00b74 + (6 - 2)\u00b72 + (7 - 3)\u00b71 + (4 - 4)\u00b710 + (5 - 5)\u00b72 = 20 burles.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
