The sentence contains the following structure:\n\n    \"Today I \" + [action_verb] + [object] + \".\"\n\n    (e.g.: \"Today I played football.\")\n\n\nYour function will return Alan's kid response, which is another sentence with the following structure:\n\n    \"I don't think you \" + [action_performed_by_alan] + \" today, I think you \" + [\"did\" OR \"didn't\"] + [verb_of _action_in_present_tense] + [\" it!\" OR \" at all!\"]\n\n    (e.g.:\"I don't think you played football today, I think you didn't play at all!\")\n\n\nNote the different structure depending on the presence of a negation in Alan's first sentence (e.g., whether Alan says \"I dind't play football\", or \"I played football\").\n\n! Also note: Alan's kid is young and only uses simple, regular verbs that use a simple \"ed\" to make past tense. \nThere are random test cases.\n\nSome more examples:\n\n    input  = \"Today I played football.\"\n    output = \"I don't think you played football today, I think you didn't play at all!\"\n    \n    input  = \"Today I didn't attempt to hardcode this Kata.\"\n    output = \"I don't think you didn't attempt to hardcode this Kata today, I think you did attempt it!\"\n          \n    input  = \"Today I didn't play football.\"\n    output = \"I don't think you didn't play football today, I think you did play it!\"\n          \n    input  = \"Today I cleaned the kitchen.\"\n    output = \"I don't think you cleaned the kitchen today, I think you didn't clean at all!\"\ndef alan_annoying_kid(s):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
