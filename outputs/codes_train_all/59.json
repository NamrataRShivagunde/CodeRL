Dark decided that the gift he is going to give to Motarack is an array $a$ of $n$ non-negative integers.\n\nDark created that array $1000$ years ago, so some elements in that array disappeared. Dark knows that Motarack hates to see an array that has two adjacent elements with a high absolute difference between them. He doesn't have much time so he wants to choose an integer $k$ ($0 \\leq k \\leq 10^{9}$) and replaces all missing elements in the array $a$ with $k$.\n\nLet $m$ be the maximum absolute difference between all adjacent elements (i.e. the maximum value of $|a_i - a_{i+1}|$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq n - 1$) in the array $a$ after Dark replaces all missing elements with $k$.\n\nDark should choose an integer $k$ so that $m$ is minimized. Can you help him?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 10^{5}$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the array $a$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($-1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10 ^ {9}$). If $a_i = -1$, then the $i$-th integer is missing. It is guaranteed that at least one integer is missing in every test case.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that the sum of $n$ for all test cases does not exceed $4 \\cdot 10 ^ {5}$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the answers for each test case in the following format:\n\nYou should print two integers, the minimum possible value of $m$ and an integer $k$ ($0 \\leq k \\leq 10^{9}$) that makes the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements in the array $a$ equal to $m$.\n\nMake sure that after replacing all the missing elements with $k$, the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements becomes $m$.\n\nIf there is more than one possible $k$, you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n7\n5\n-1 10 -1 12 -1\n5\n-1 40 35 -1 35\n6\n-1 -1 9 -1 3 -1\n2\n-1 -1\n2\n0 -1\n4\n1 -1 3 -1\n7\n1 -1 7 5 2 -1 5\n\nOutput\n1 11\n5 35\n3 6\n0 42\n0 0\n1 2\n3 4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case after replacing all missing elements with $11$ the array becomes $[11, 10, 11, 12, 11]$. The absolute difference between any adjacent elements is $1$. It is impossible to choose a value of $k$, such that the absolute difference between any adjacent element will be $\\leq 0$. So, the answer is $1$.\n\nIn the third test case after replacing all missing elements with $6$ the array becomes $[6, 6, 9, 6, 3, 6]$.  $|a_1 - a_2| = |6 - 6| = 0$;  $|a_2 - a_3| = |6 - 9| = 3$;  $|a_3 - a_4| = |9 - 6| = 3$;  $|a_4 - a_5| = |6 - 3| = 3$;  $|a_5 - a_6| = |3 - 6| = 3$. \n\nSo, the maximum difference between any adjacent elements is $3$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
