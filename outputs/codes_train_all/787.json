bear.\nHe is playing a video game and he needs your help.\nThere is a row with N cells, each either empty or occupied by a soldier, denoted by '0' and '1' respectively.\nThe goal of the game is to move all soldiers to the right (they should occupy some number of rightmost cells).\nThe only possible command is choosing a soldier and telling him to move to the right as far as possible.\nChoosing a soldier takes 1 second, and a soldier moves with the speed of a cell per second.\nThe soldier stops immediately if he is in the last cell of the row or the next cell is already occupied.\nLimak isn't allowed to choose a soldier that can't move at all (the chosen soldier must move at least one cell to the right).\nLimak enjoys this game very much and wants to play as long as possible.\nIn particular, he doesn't start a new command while the previously chosen soldier moves.\nCan you tell him, how many seconds he can play at most?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a string S describing the row with N cells.\nEach character is either '0' or '1', denoting an empty cell or a cell with a soldier respectively.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number of seconds Limak will play the game.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 5\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105 (N denotes the length of the string S)\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask #1 (25 points): 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10\n- Subtask #2 (25 points): 1 \u2264 N \u2264 2000\n- Subtask #3 (50 points): Original constraints.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n4\n10100\n1100001\n000000000111\n001110100011010\n\nOutput:\n8\n10\n0\n48\n\n-----Explanation-----\nTest case 1.\nThe initial string is 10100.\nThere are N = 5 cells.\nThere is one soldier in the first cell, and one soldier in the third cell.\nThe following scenario maximizes the total time:\n- Limak chooses the soldier in the first cell.\nThis soldier can move only one cell to the right.\nIt takes 1 second to choose a soldier and 1 second for a soldier to move to the next cell (2 seconds in total).\nThe string is 01100 now.\n- Limak has only one choice.\nHe must choose the soldier in the third cell because the other soldier can't move at all (the soldier in the second cell can't move to the right because the next cell is already occupied).\nChoosing a soldier takes 1 second.\nThe chosen soldier moves from the third cell to the fifth cell, which takes 2 seconds.\nThis operation takes 1 + 2 = 3 seconds in total.\nThe string is 01001 now.\n- Limak has only one choice again.\nSince the soldier in the last row can't move further to the right, the soldier in the second cell must be chosen.\nHe will move 2 cells to the right.\nThis operation takes 1 + 2 = 3 seconds in total.\nThe string become 00011 and the game is over.\nThe total time is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.\nTest case 2.\nThe initial string is 1100001.\nThere is only one possible scenario:\n- 1100001 is changed to 1000011 in 5 seconds (1 second to choose a soldier and 4 seconds for the soldier to move 4 cells to the right).\n- 1000011 is changed to 0000111 in 5 seconds.\n\nThe total time is 5 + 5 = 10 seconds.\nTest case 3.\nThe game is over immediately because all soldiers occupy rightmost cells already.\nThe answer is 0.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
