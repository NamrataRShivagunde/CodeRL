"prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nYou play a computer game. In this game, you lead a party of $m$ heroes, and you have to clear a dungeon with $n$ monsters. Each monster is characterized by its power $a_i$. Each hero is characterized by his power $p_i$ and endurance $s_i$.\n\nThe heroes clear the dungeon day by day. In the beginning of each day, you choose a hero (exactly one) who is going to enter the dungeon this day.\n\nWhen the hero enters the dungeon, he is challenged by the first monster which was not defeated during the previous days (so, if the heroes have already defeated $k$ monsters, the hero fights with the monster $k + 1$). When the hero fights the monster, there are two possible outcomes:\n\n  if the monster's power is strictly greater than the hero's power, the hero retreats from the dungeon. The current day ends;  otherwise, the monster is defeated. \n\nAfter defeating a monster, the hero either continues fighting with the next monster or leaves the dungeon. He leaves the dungeon either if he has already defeated the number of monsters equal to his endurance during this day (so, the $i$-th hero cannot defeat more than $s_i$ monsters during each day), or if all monsters are defeated \u2014 otherwise, he fights with the next monster. When the hero leaves the dungeon, the current day ends.\n\nYour goal is to defeat the last monster. What is the minimum number of days that you need to achieve your goal? Each day you have to use exactly one hero; it is possible that some heroes don't fight the monsters at all. Each hero can be used arbitrary number of times.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of monsters in the dungeon.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the power of the $i$-th monster.\n\nThe third line contains one integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of heroes in your party.\n\nThen $m$ lines follow, each describing a hero. Each line contains two integers $p_i$ and $s_i$ ($1 \\le p_i \\le 10^9$, $1 \\le s_i \\le n$) \u2014 the power and the endurance of the $i$-th hero.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n + m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of days you have to spend to defeat all of the monsters (or $-1$ if it is impossible).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n6\n2 3 11 14 1 8\n2\n3 2\n100 1\n5\n3 5 100 2 3\n2\n30 5\n90 1\n\nOutput\n5\n-1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
