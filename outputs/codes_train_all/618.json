are $N$ bags numbered $1$ to $N$. The $i_{th}$ bag contains $A_i$ coins. The bags are placed in a circular order such that the $N_{th}$ bag is adjacent to the $1^{st}$ bag. \nDD can select $K$ consecutive adjacent bags and take all the coins in them.   Help her find the maximum number of coins she can take by making the ideal choice.\nNote that the selected bags must be consecutive. Since they are placed in circular order, bag number $1$ and $N$ are considered to be consecutive.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases.
