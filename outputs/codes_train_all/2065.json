He is now investigating the case of vandalism at the exhibition of contemporary art.\n\nThe main exhibit is a construction of n matryoshka dolls that can be nested one into another. The matryoshka dolls are numbered from 1 to n. A matryoshka with a smaller number can be nested in a matryoshka with a higher number, two matryoshkas can not be directly nested in the same doll, but there may be chain nestings, for example, 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 5. \n\nIn one second, you can perform one of the two following operations:  Having a matryoshka a that isn't nested in any other matryoshka and a matryoshka b, such that b doesn't contain any other matryoshka and is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may put a in b;  Having a matryoshka a directly contained in matryoshka b, such that b is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may get a out of b. \n\nAccording to the modern aesthetic norms the matryoshka dolls on display were assembled in a specific configuration, i.e. as several separate chains of nested matryoshkas, but the criminal, following the mysterious plan, took out all the dolls and assembled them into a single large chain (1 \u2192 2 \u2192 ... \u2192 n). In order to continue the investigation Andrewid needs to know in what minimum time it is possible to perform this action.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of matryoshkas and matryoshka chains in the initial configuration.\n\nThe next k lines contain the descriptions of the chains: the i-th line first contains number m_{i} (1 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 n), and then m_{i} numbers a_{i}1, a_{i}2, ..., a_{im}_{i} \u2014 the numbers of matryoshkas in the chain (matryoshka a_{i}1 is nested into matryoshka a_{i}2, that is nested into matryoshka a_{i}3, and so on till the matryoshka a_{im}_{i} that isn't nested into any other matryoshka).\n\nIt is guaranteed that m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_{k} = n, the numbers of matryoshkas in all the chains are distinct, in each chain the numbers of matryoshkas follow in the ascending order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the single line print the minimum number of seconds needed to assemble one large chain from the initial configuration.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test there are two chains: 1 \u2192 2 and 3. In one second you can nest the first chain into the second one and get 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3.\n\nIn the second sample test you need to disassemble all the three chains into individual matryoshkas in 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 seconds and then assemble one big chain in 6 seconds.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
