vijju123\nChef was reading some quotes by great people. Now, he is interested in classifying all the fancy quotes he knows. He thinks that all fancy quotes which contain the word \"not\" are Real Fancy; quotes that do not contain it are regularly fancy.\nYou are given some quotes. For each quote, you need to tell Chef if it is Real Fancy or just regularly fancy.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ denoting a quote.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string \"Real Fancy\" or \"regularly fancy\" (without quotes).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 50$\n- $1 \\le |S| \\le 100$\n- each character of $S$ is either a lowercase English letter or a space\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n2\ni do not have any fancy quotes\nwhen nothing goes right go left\n\n-----Example Output-----\nReal Fancy\nregularly fancy\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: \"i do not have any fancy quotes\"\nExample case 2: The word \"not\" does not appear in the given quote.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
