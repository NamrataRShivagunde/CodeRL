If two or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the second position to resolve the conflict, if they tie again, we continue this process until the ties are resolved. If two or more teams are still tied after considering all positions, we rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.\nGiven an array of strings votes which is the votes of all voters in the ranking systems. Sort all teams according to the ranking system described above.\nReturn a string of all teams sorted by the ranking system.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: votes = [\"ABC\",\"ACB\",\"ABC\",\"ACB\",\"ACB\"]\nOutput: \"ACB\"\nExplanation: Team A was ranked first place by 5 voters. No other team was voted as first place so team A is the first team.\nTeam B was ranked second by 2 voters and was ranked third by 3 voters.\nTeam C was ranked second by 3 voters and was ranked third by 2 voters.\nAs most of the voters ranked C second, team C is the second team and team B is the third.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: votes = [\"WXYZ\",\"XYZW\"]\nOutput: \"XWYZ\"\nExplanation: X is the winner due to tie-breaking rule. X has same votes as W for the first position but X has one vote as second position while W doesn't have any votes as second position. \n\nExample 3:\nInput: votes = [\"ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK\"]\nOutput: \"ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK\"\nExplanation: Only one voter so his votes are used for the ranking.\n\nExample 4:\nInput: votes = [\"BCA\",\"CAB\",\"CBA\",\"ABC\",\"ACB\",\"BAC\"]\nOutput: \"ABC\"\nExplanation: \nTeam A was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.\nTeam B was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.\nTeam C was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.\nThere is a tie and we rank teams ascending by their IDs.\n\nExample 5:\nInput: votes = [\"M\",\"M\",\"M\",\"M\"]\nOutput: \"M\"\nExplanation: Only team M in the competition so it has the first rank.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= votes.length <= 1000\n1 <= votes[i].length <= 26\nvotes[i].length ==\u00a0votes[j].length for\u00a00 <= i, j < votes.length.\nvotes[i][j] is an English upper-case letter.\nAll characters of votes[i] are unique.\nAll the characters\u00a0that occur\u00a0in votes[0] also\u00a0occur\u00a0in votes[j] where 1 <= j < votes.length.\nclass Solution:\n    def rankTeams(self, votes: List[str]) -> str:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
