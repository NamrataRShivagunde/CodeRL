His pokemon can perform the following moves:  \n- Tackle - Deal damage worth $X$ points  \n- Grow - Increase damage by $Y$ points i.e. $X$ = $X$ + $Y$ \nBut, it can only perform Grow first (0 or more times) and then tackle (0 or more) times after which it cannot perform Grow again.\n\nThat is, it cannot perform the Grow operation once it has performed the tackle operation.  \nA pokemon can be caught only if it\u2019s health is exactly 1. A wild pokemon has appeared and has health worth $H$ points. Find the minimum number of moves required to catch it or say that it is not possible.  \n\n-----Input:-----\n- \nThe first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.\n- \nEach test case consists of 3 space-separated integers $H$, $X$ and $Y$.\n\n-----Output:-----\n- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum number of moves required to catch the pokemon if it is possible to catch it else print -1.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- \n1 <= $T$ <= 103\n- \n1 <=  $X$, $Y$ < $H$ <= 109\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n- 1 <=  $X$, $Y$ < $H$ <= 1000\nSubtask #2 (70 points):\n- Original Constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n\n101 10 10\n\n11 3 3  \n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n6\n\n-1  \n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\n- \nExample Case 1:\n\nAsh can make use of Grow once. So $X$ = 10 + 10 = 20\n\nThen he can do Tackle 5 times to decrease $H$ to 1.\n\nOR\n\nAsh can make use of Grow 4 times. So $X$ = 10 + 4*10 = 50\n\nThen he can do Tackle 2 times to decrease $H$ to 1.\n\nHence, a total of 6 moves are required either way which is minimum.  \n- \nExample Case 2:\n\nNo matter how many times Ash uses Grow or Tackle, pokemon can never be caught.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
