Only those permutations that minimize secret value might be the phone of her husband.\n\nThe sequence of $n$ integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from $1$ to $n$ exactly once.\n\nThe secret value of a phone number is defined as the sum of the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and length of the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS). \n\nA subsequence $a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\ldots, a_{i_k}$ where $1\\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k\\leq n$ is called increasing if $a_{i_1} < a_{i_2} < a_{i_3} < \\ldots < a_{i_k}$. If $a_{i_1} > a_{i_2} > a_{i_3} > \\ldots > a_{i_k}$, a subsequence is called decreasing. An increasing/decreasing subsequence is called longest if it has maximum length among all increasing/decreasing subsequences.\n\nFor example, if there is a permutation $[6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 3, 5]$, LIS of this permutation will be $[1, 2, 3, 5]$, so the length of LIS is equal to $4$. LDS can be $[6, 4, 1]$, $[6, 4, 2]$, or $[6, 4, 3]$, so the length of LDS is $3$.\n\nNote, the lengths of LIS and LDS can be different.\n\nSo please help Mrs. Smith to find a permutation that gives a minimum sum of lengths of LIS and LDS.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of permutation that you need to build.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a permutation that gives a minimum sum of lengths of LIS and LDS. \n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n3 4 1 2\n\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\n2 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, you can build a permutation $[3, 4, 1, 2]$. LIS is $[3, 4]$ (or $[1, 2]$), so the length of LIS is equal to $2$. LDS can be ony of $[3, 1]$, $[4, 2]$, $[3, 2]$, or $[4, 1]$. The length of LDS is also equal to $2$. The sum is equal to $4$. Note that $[3, 4, 1, 2]$ is not the only permutation that is valid.\n\nIn the second sample, you can build a permutation $[2, 1]$. LIS is $[1]$ (or $[2]$), so the length of LIS is equal to $1$. LDS is $[2, 1]$, so the length of LDS is equal to $2$. The sum is equal to $3$. Note that permutation $[1, 2]$ is also valid.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
