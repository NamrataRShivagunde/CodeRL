For example, for N=20, G=4, D=5, the solution at Wolfram MathWorld is\n\n```\n Mon:   ABCD    EFGH    IJKL    MNOP    QRST\n Tue:   AEIM    BJOQ    CHNT    DGLS    FKPR\n Wed:   AGKO    BIPT    CFMS    DHJR    ELNQ\n Thu:   AHLP    BKNS    CEOR    DFIQ    GJMT\n Fri:   AFJN    BLMR    CGPQ    DEKT    HIOS\n```\n\nWrite a function that validates a proposed solution, a list of list of strings, as being a solution to the social golfer problem. Each character represents a golfer, and each string is a group of players. Rows represent days. The solution above would be encoded as:\n\n```\n [\n  ['ABCD', 'EFGH', 'IJKL', 'MNOP', 'QRST'],\n  ['AEIM', 'BJOQ', 'CHNT', 'DGLS', 'FKPR'],\n  ['AGKO', 'BIPT', 'CFMS', 'DHJR', 'ELNQ'],\n  ['AHLP', 'BKNS', 'CEOR', 'DFIQ', 'GJMT'],\n  ['AFJN', 'BLMR', 'CGPQ', 'DEKT', 'HIOS']\n ]\n```\n\nYou need to make sure (1) that each golfer plays exactly once every day, (2) that the number and size of the groups is the same every day, and (3) that each player plays with every other player *at most* once.\n\nSo although each player must play every day, there can be particular pairs of players that never play together.\n\nIt is not necessary to consider the case where the number of golfers is zero; no tests will check for that. If you do wish to consider that case, note that you should accept as valid all possible solutions for zero golfers, who (vacuously) can indeed play in an unlimited number of groups of zero.\ndef valid(a):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
