Otherwise print  (without quotes) \"No\"\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T, N, L, B \u2264 1000\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n3\n2\n5 3\n4\n4 8\n1\n1 2\n\nOutput:\nYes 2\nNo\nYes 1\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1. First friend divides 5x3 cake in 3x3 and 2x3 since 3x3 is largest possible square, second Friend divides 2x3 cake in 2x2 and 1x2 and eat 2x2 piece.
