According to information gathered by the organization, there are $N$ alien spaceships (numbered $1$ through $N$) planning to invade the earth. The $i$-th spaceship will appear on the radar at time $C_i$. Each spaceship needs $D$ time to reach earth once it appears on the radar. \nChef's organization owns a huge laser cannon which can destroy one spaceship in one shot. However, once the cannon is used once it needs some amount of cool-down time in order to be used again (first shot doesn't require cool-down time before it is used). This cool-down time, however, is configurable. It has to be set before the first shot, and cannot be changed after that. If Chef sets a lower cool-down time, that would increase the energy consumed by the cannon, and vice-versa - the higher the cool-down time, the lower the energy consumed.\nThis might be a long battle, and Chef wants to use as little energy as possible. So Chef wants to maximize the cool-down time while still being able to destroy all spaceships before any of them arrive on earth. In particular, the $i$-th spaceship should be shot between the times $C_i$ and $C_i + D$ (both end points inclusive).\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains two integers $N$ and $D$. \n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_N$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one real number\u2015 the maximum cool-down time possible. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error of the answer does not exceed $10^{-6}$.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq C_i \\leq 10^9$ for each valid $i$\n- $1 \\leq D \\leq 10^9$\n- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (50 points): \n- $N \\le 1,000$\n- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10,000$\nSubtask #2 (50 points): Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n3 2\n3 2 3\n2 1\n5 6\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n1.5000000000\n2.0000000000\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
