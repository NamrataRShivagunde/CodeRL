is the price of a given stock on day i.\n\nDesign an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).\n\nNote: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\n\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: [7,1,5,3,6,4]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.\n\u00a0            Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.\n\u00a0            Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are\n\u00a0            engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: [7,6,4,3,1]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.\nclass Solution:\n    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
