Their favorite occupation is to sort collections of coins. Sasha likes having things in order, that is why he wants his coins to be arranged in a row in such a way that firstly come coins out of circulation, and then come coins still in circulation. \n\nFor arranging coins Dima uses the following algorithm. One step of his algorithm looks like the following:\n\n  He looks through all the coins from left to right;  If he sees that the i-th coin is still in circulation, and (i + 1)-th coin is already out of circulation, he exchanges these two coins and continues watching coins from (i + 1)-th.  \n\nDima repeats the procedure above until it happens that no two coins were exchanged during this procedure. Dima calls hardness of ordering the number of steps required for him according to the algorithm above to sort the sequence, e.g. the number of times he looks through the coins from the very beginning. For example, for the ordered sequence hardness of ordering equals one.\n\nToday Sasha invited Dima and proposed him a game. First he puts n coins in a row, all of them are out of circulation. Then Sasha chooses one of the coins out of circulation and replaces it with a coin in circulation for n times. During this process Sasha constantly asks Dima what is the hardness of ordering of the sequence. \n\nThe task is more complicated because Dima should not touch the coins and he should determine hardness of ordering in his mind. Help Dima with this task. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300 000)\u00a0\u2014 number of coins that Sasha puts behind Dima.\n\nSecond line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014 positions that Sasha puts coins in circulation to. At first Sasha replaces coin located at position p_1, then coin located at position p_2 and so on. Coins are numbered from left to right.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint n + 1 numbers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n}, where a_0 is a hardness of ordering at the beginning, a_1 is a hardness of ordering after the first replacement and so on. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 3 4 2\n\nOutput\n1 2 3 2 1\n\nInput\n8\n6 8 3 4 7 2 1 5\n\nOutput\n1 2 2 3 4 3 4 5 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's denote as O coin out of circulation, and as X \u2014 coin is circulation.\n\nAt the first sample, initially in row there are coins that are not in circulation, so Dima will look through them from left to right and won't make any exchanges.\n\nAfter replacement of the first coin with a coin in circulation, Dima will exchange this coin with next three times and after that he will finally look through the coins and finish the process.\n\nXOOO  \u2192  OOOX\n\nAfter replacement of the third coin, Dima's actions look this way:\n\nXOXO  \u2192  OXOX  \u2192  OOXX\n\nAfter replacement of the fourth coin, Dima's actions look this way:\n\nXOXX  \u2192  OXXX\n\nFinally, after replacement of the second coin, row becomes consisting of coins that are in circulation and Dima will look through coins from left to right without any exchanges.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
