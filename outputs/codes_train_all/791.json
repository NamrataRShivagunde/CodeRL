This time around, Snuffles has an array A containing N integers: A1, A2, ..., AN.\nBad news: Snuffles only loves to play with an array in which all the elements are equal.\nGood news: We have a mover of size D. ! \nA mover of size D is a tool which helps to change arrays. Chef can pick two existing elements Ai and Aj from the array, such that i + D = j and subtract 1 from one of these elements (the element should have its value at least 1), and add 1 to the other element. In effect, a single operation of the mover, moves a value of 1 from one of the elements to the other.\nChef wants to find the minimum number of times she needs to use the mover of size D to make all the elements of the array A equal. Help her find this out.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains two integers N and D, denoting the number of elements in the array and the size of the mover. \n- The second line of each testcase contains N space-separated integers: A1, A2, ..., AN, denoting the initial elements of the array. \n\n-----Output-----\n- For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of uses or -1 if it is impossible to do what Snuffles wants.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n- 2 \u2264 N \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 D < N\n- 1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 109\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 (30 points) : N \u2264  103\n- Subtask 2 (70 points) : Original constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n3\n5 2\n1 4 5 2 3\n3 1\n1 4 1\n4 2\n3 4 3 5\n\nOutput:\n3\n2\n-1\n\n-----Explanation-----\nTestcase 1:\nHere is a possible sequence of usages of the mover:\n- Move 1 from A3 to A1\n- Move 1 from A3 to A1\n- Move 1 from A2 to A4\nAt the end, the array becomes (3, 3, 3, 3, 3), which Snuffles likes. And you cannot achieve this in fewer moves. Hence the answer is 3.\nTestcase 2:\nHere is a possible sequence of usages of the mover:\n- Move 1 from A2 to A1\n- Move 1 from A2 to A3\nAt the end, the array becomes (2, 2, 2), which Snuffles likes. And you cannot achieve this in fewer moves. Hence the answer is 2.\nTestcase 3:\nIt is impossible to make all the elements equal. Hence the answer is -1.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
