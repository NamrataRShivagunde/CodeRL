She can take up only one shift from 6 shifts a day i.e. from 10 am to 4 pm. She needs to save 300$ after completion of the month. She works only for $D$ days in the month. She estimates that she gets her highest tip in the first shift and the tip starts decreasing by 2% every hour as the day prolongs. She gets a minimum wage of $X$ $ for every shift. And her highest tip in the first shift is $Y$ $. Determine whether Mia will be able to save 300$ from her wages and tips after working $D$ days of the month. If she can, print YES, else print NO.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 8 <= D <=30\n- 7 <= X <=30\n- 4 <= Y <= 20\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line has three parameters $D$, $X$ and $Y$ i.e. number of days worked, minimum wage and highest tip.\n- Second line contains D integers indicating her shifts every $i$-th day she has worked.\n\n-----Output:-----\n- Print YES, if Mia has saved 300$, NO otherwise.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n9 17 5\n1 3 2 4 5 6 1 2 2\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\nNO\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nNo. of days Mia worked (D) is 9, so minimum wage she earns (X) is 17 dollars. Highest tip at first hour (Y) = 5 dollars, 1st day she took 1st shift and 2nd day she took 3rd shift and so on. Upon calculation we will find that Mia was not able to save 300 dollars.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
