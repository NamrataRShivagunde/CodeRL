Chef wants to solve a series problem but he can't \nsolve it till now.Can you help Chef to solve the series problem?\n- In series problem, the series goes as follows 1,9,31,73,141 . . . . . . . . \nYour task is to find the Nth term of series. For larger value of $N$ answer becomes very large, So your output should be performed $N$th term modulo 1000000007 ($10^9+7$ ).\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$. \n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase,  output in a single line answer i.e. The $N$th term of series modulo 1000000007.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^9$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n\n8\n\n10\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n561\n\n1081\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
