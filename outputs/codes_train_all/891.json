He is asking you to solve following problem: Given an integer number N and two sets of integer A and B. Let set A contain all numbers from 1 to N and set B contain all numbers from N + 1 to 2N. Multiset C contains all sums a + b such that a belongs to A and b belongs to B. Note that multiset may contain several elements with the same values. For example, if N equals to three, then A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {4, 5, 6} and C = {5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9}. Andrii has M queries about multiset C. Every query is defined by a single integer q. Andrii wants to know the number of times q is contained in C. For example, number 6 is contained two times, 1 is not contained in C at all. \n\nPlease, help Andrii to answer all the queries.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers N and M. Each of the next M line contains one integer q, the query asked by Andrii.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the answer for each query in separate lines as in example.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 109\n- 1 \u2264 M \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 q \u2264 3N\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n3 5\n6\n2\n9\n7\n5\nOutput:\n2\n0\n1\n3\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
