Each character of $s$ is either 'L' or 'R'. It means that if the frog is staying at the $i$-th cell and the $i$-th character is 'L', the frog can jump only to the left. If the frog is staying at the $i$-th cell and the $i$-th character is 'R', the frog can jump only to the right. The frog can jump only to the right from the cell $0$.\n\nNote that the frog can jump into the same cell twice and can perform as many jumps as it needs.\n\nThe frog wants to reach the $n+1$-th cell. The frog chooses some positive integer value $d$ before the first jump (and cannot change it later) and jumps by no more than $d$ cells at once. I.e. if the $i$-th character is 'L' then the frog can jump to any cell in a range $[max(0, i - d); i - 1]$, and if the $i$-th character is 'R' then the frog can jump to any cell in a range $[i + 1; min(n + 1; i + d)]$.\n\nThe frog doesn't want to jump far, so your task is to find the minimum possible value of $d$ such that the frog can reach the cell $n+1$ from the cell $0$ if it can jump by no more than $d$ cells at once. It is guaranteed that it is always possible to reach $n+1$ from $0$.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe next $t$ lines describe test cases.
