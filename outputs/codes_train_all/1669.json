array of integers.\nNow she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size W, and consists of W consecutive cards.\nReturn true if and only if she can.\n\u00a0\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], W = 3\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8].\nExample 2:\nInput: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], W = 4\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Alice's hand can't be rearranged into groups of 4.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= hand.length <= 10000\n0 <= hand[i]\u00a0<= 10^9\n1 <= W <= hand.length\n\nNote: This question is
