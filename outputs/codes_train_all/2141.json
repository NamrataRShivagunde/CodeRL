The vertices of the tree are numbered from $1$ to $n$. Each of its vertices also has an integer $a_i$ written on it. For each vertex $i$, Evlampiy calculated $c_i$\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices $j$ in the subtree of vertex $i$, such that $a_j < a_i$. [Image]Illustration for the second example, the first integer is $a_i$ and the integer in parentheses is $c_i$\n\nAfter the new year, Evlampiy could not remember what his gift was! He remembers the tree and the values of $c_i$, but he completely forgot which integers $a_i$ were written on the vertices.\n\nHelp him to restore initial integers!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ $(1 \\leq n \\leq 2000)$ \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe next $n$ lines contain descriptions of vertices: the $i$-th line contains two integers $p_i$ and $c_i$ ($0 \\leq p_i \\leq n$; $0 \\leq c_i \\leq n-1$), where $p_i$ is the parent of vertex $i$ or $0$ if vertex $i$ is root, and $c_i$ is the number of vertices $j$ in the subtree of vertex $i$, such that $a_j < a_i$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the values of $p_i$ describe a rooted tree with $n$ vertices.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf a solution exists, in the first line print \"YES\", and in the second line output $n$ integers $a_i$ $(1 \\leq a_i \\leq {10}^{9})$. If there are several solutions, output any of them. One can prove that if there is a solution, then there is also a solution in which all $a_i$ are between $1$ and $10^9$.\n\nIf there are no solutions, print \"NO\".\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n2 0\n0 2\n2 0\n\nOutput\nYES\n1 2 1 \nInput\n5\n0 1\n1 3\n2 1\n3 0\n2 0\n\nOutput\nYES\n2 3 2 1 2\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
