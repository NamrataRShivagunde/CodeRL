Since Hari has spent several months playing chess with his friends, he has now decided to take part in some chess tournament in Cheftown.\n\nThere are currently two tournaments going on in Cheftown and each tournament has its own entry fee. Due to this economical restriction and his budget, Hari can take part in only one tournament.\n\nThe entry fee for first tournament is F1 units of money. The structure of tournament is as follows: first there will be group matches and then there will be finals. If Hari reaches in finals and wins it, he'll get R1 units of money. If after reaching in finals, Hari loses, he'll get R2 units of money. If Hari fails to reach in finals, he'll get nothing. The probability of reaching in finals of first tournament for Hari is p1 and probability of winning in finals after reaching is p2.\n\nThe entry fee for second tournament is F2 units of money. The structure of tournament is as follows: first there will be group matches and then there will be finals. If Hari reaches in finals, he'll immediately get R3 units of money, otherwise he'll get nothing. If after reaching in finals, Hari wins, he'll get R4 units of money. The probability of reaching in finals of second tournament for Hari is p3 and probability of winning in finals after reaching is p4.\n\nNow, Hari wants to maximise his profit. He wants to know which tournament he should participate in such that his expected profit is maximised. Help Hari in deciding this.\n\nNote:\nIn the tournaments of Cheftown, the game never ends with a draw. So, either Hari wins a game, or he loses.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of the input contains T, the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as following:\n\nFirst line of each test case contains 6 integers F1, F2, R1, R2, R3 and R4.\n\nNext line of each test case contains 4 floating point numbers p1, p2, p3 and p4.\nEach number has exactly 2 digits after decimal point.\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output a single line having \"FIRST\" if expected profit of first tournament is maximum or \"SECOND\" if expected profit of second tournament is maximum or \"BOTH\" if expected profits of both the tournaments is exactly same.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n- 1 \u2264 F1, F2, R1, R2, R3, R4 \u2264 100\n- 0.00 \u2264 p1, p2, p3, p4 \u2264 1.00\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask#1: 30 points\n- p1 = p3 and p2 = p4\n\nSubtask#2: 70 points\n- All usual constraints.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2\n30 50 70 10 40 30\n0.25 0.10 0.30 0.05\n50 36 80 38 65 32\n0.55 0.12 0.33 0.54\n\nOutput:\nFIRST\nSECOND\n\n-----Explanation-----\n\nIn the first case, the expected profit for first tournament is -26.00 and expected profit for second tournament is -37.55. So, first tournament has better expected profit.\n\nIn the second case, the expected profit for first tournament is -26.328 and expected profit for second tournament is -8.8476. So, second tournament has better expected profit.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
