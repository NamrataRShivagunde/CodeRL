row.\u00a0 The i-th pile has stones[i] stones.\nA move consists of merging exactly\u00a0K\u00a0consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these K piles.\nFind the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile.\u00a0 If it is impossible, return -1.\n\u00a0\n\nExample 1:\nInput: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 2\nOutput: 20\nExplanation: \nWe start with [3, 2, 4, 1].\nWe merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].\nWe merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].\nWe merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].\nThe total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 3\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: stones = [3,5,1,2,6], K = 3\nOutput: 25\nExplanation: \nWe start with [3, 5, 1, 2, 6].\nWe merge [5, 1, 2] for a cost of 8, and we are left with [3, 8, 6].\nWe merge [3, 8, 6] for a cost of 17, and we are left with [17].\nThe total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.\n\n\u00a0\nNote:\n\n1 <= stones.length <= 30\n2 <= K <= 30\n1 <= stones[i] <= 100\nclass Solution:\n    def mergeStones(self, stones: List[int], K: int) -> int:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
