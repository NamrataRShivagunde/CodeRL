He prepared and carefully studied the rules by which the exam passes.\n\nThe exam consists of $n$ problems that can be solved in $T$ minutes. Thus, the exam begins at time $0$ and ends at time $T$. Petya can leave the exam at any integer time from $0$ to $T$, inclusive.\n\nAll problems are divided into two types:   easy problems \u2014 Petya takes exactly $a$ minutes to solve any easy problem;  hard problems \u2014 Petya takes exactly $b$ minutes ($b > a$) to solve any hard problem. \n\nThus, if Petya starts solving an easy problem at time $x$, then it will be solved at time $x+a$. Similarly, if at a time $x$ Petya starts to solve a hard problem, then it will be solved at time $x+b$.\n\nFor every problem, Petya knows if it is easy or hard. Also, for each problem is determined time $t_i$ ($0 \\le t_i \\le T$) at which it will become mandatory (required). If Petya leaves the exam at time $s$ and there is such a problem $i$ that $t_i \\le s$ and he didn't solve it, then he will receive $0$ points for the whole exam. Otherwise (i.e if he has solved all such problems for which $t_i \\le s$) he will receive a number of points equal to the number of solved problems. Note that leaving at time $s$ Petya can have both \"mandatory\" and \"non-mandatory\" problems solved.\n\nFor example, if $n=2$, $T=5$, $a=2$, $b=3$, the first problem is hard and $t_1=3$ and the second problem is easy and $t_2=2$. Then:  if he leaves at time $s=0$, then he will receive $0$ points since he will not have time to solve any problems;  if he leaves at time $s=1$, he will receive $0$ points since he will not have time to solve any problems;  if he leaves at time $s=2$, then he can get a $1$ point by solving the problem with the number $2$ (it must be solved in the range from $0$ to $2$);  if he leaves at time $s=3$, then he will receive $0$ points since at this moment both problems will be mandatory, but he will not be able to solve both of them;  if he leaves at time $s=4$, then he will receive $0$ points since at this moment both problems will be mandatory, but he will not be able to solve both of them;  if he leaves at time $s=5$, then he can get $2$ points by solving all problems. \n\nThus, the answer to this test is $2$.\n\nHelp Petya to determine the maximal number of points that he can receive, before leaving the exam.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 10^4$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nThe next lines contain a description of $m$ test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains four integers $n, T, a, b$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$, $1 \\le T \\le 10^9$, $1 \\le a < b \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of problems, minutes given for the exam and the time to solve an easy and hard problem, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ numbers $0$ or $1$, separated by single space: the $i$-th number means the type of the $i$-th problem. A value of $0$ means that the problem is easy, and a value of $1$ that the problem is hard.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $t_i$ ($0 \\le t_i \\le T$), where the $i$-th number means the time at which the $i$-th problem will become mandatory.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ for all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the answers to $m$ test cases. For each set, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 maximal number of points that he can receive, before leaving the exam.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n10\n3 5 1 3\n0 0 1\n2 1 4\n2 5 2 3\n1 0\n3 2\n1 20 2 4\n0\n16\n6 20 2 5\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 8 2 9 11 6\n4 16 3 6\n1 0 1 1\n8 3 5 6\n6 20 3 6\n0 1 0 0 1 0\n20 11 3 20 16 17\n7 17 1 6\n1 1 0 1 0 0 0\n1 7 0 11 10 15 10\n6 17 2 6\n0 0 1 0 0 1\n7 6 3 7 10 12\n5 17 2 5\n1 1 1 1 0\n17 11 10 6 4\n1 1 1 2\n0\n1\n\nOutput\n3\n2\n1\n0\n1\n4\n0\n1\n2\n1\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
