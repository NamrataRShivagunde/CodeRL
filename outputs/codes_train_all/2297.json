Here, you need to have at least A_v yen in your pocket when you perform this move.\n - Donate B_v yen to the vertex v you are standing on. Here, the amount of money in your pocket must not become less than 0 yen.\nYou win the game when you donate once to every vertex.\nFind the smallest initial amount of money W that enables you to win the game.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - N-1 \\leq M \\leq 10^5\n - 1 \\leq A_i,B_i \\leq 10^9\n - 1 \\leq U_i < V_i \\leq N\n - The given graph is connected and simple (there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices).\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\nA_1 B_1\nA_2 B_2\n:\nA_N B_N\nU_1 V_1\nU_2 V_2\n:\nU_M V_M\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the smallest initial amount of money W that enables you to win the game.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n4 5\n3 1\n1 2\n4 1\n6 2\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n1 4\n3 4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n6\n\nIf you have 6 yen initially, you can win the game as follows:\n - Stand on Vertex 4. This is possible since you have not less than 6 yen.\n - Donate 2 yen to Vertex 4. Now you have 4 yen.\n - Move to Vertex 3. This is possible since you have not less than 4 yen.\n - Donate 1 yen to Vertex 3. Now you have 3 yen.\n - Move to Vertex 2. This is possible since you have not less than 1 yen.\n - Move to Vertex 1. This is possible since you have not less than 3 yen.\n - Donate 1 yen to Vertex 1. Now you have 2 yen.\n - Move to Vertex 2. This is possible since you have not less than 1 yen.\n - Donate 2 yen to Vertex 2. Now you have 0 yen.\nIf you have less than 6 yen initially, you cannot win the game. Thus, the answer is 6.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
