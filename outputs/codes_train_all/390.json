player makes a\u00a0move\u00a0consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.\nAlso, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.\nGiven a positive\u00a0integer n.\u00a0Return\u00a0True\u00a0if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return False, assuming both players play optimally.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 4\nOutput: true\nExplanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).\n\nExample 4:\nInput: n = 7\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.\nIf Alice starts removing 4 stones, Bob will remove 1 stone then Alice should remove only 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0). \nIf Alice starts removing 1 stone, Bob will remove 4 stones then Alice only can remove 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0).\nExample 5:\nInput: n = 17\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 10^5\nclass Solution:\n    def winnerSquareGame(self, n: int) -> bool:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
