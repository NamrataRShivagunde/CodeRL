position.\nAlong the way, there are gas stations.\u00a0 Each station[i]\u00a0represents a gas station that is station[i][0] miles east of the starting position, and has station[i][1] liters of gas.\nThe car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has\u00a0startFuel\u00a0liters of fuel in it.\u00a0 It uses 1 liter of gas per 1 mile that it drives.\nWhen the car\u00a0reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.\nWhat is the least number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination?\u00a0 If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.\nNote that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there.\u00a0 If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.\n\u00a0\n\nExample 1:\nInput: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: We can reach the target without refueling.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: We can't reach the target (or even the first gas station).\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nWe start with 10 liters of fuel.\nWe drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters to 60 liters of gas.\nThen, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),\nand refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach the target.\nWe made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.\n\n\u00a0\nNote:\n\n1 <= target, startFuel, stations[i][1] <= 10^9\n0 <= stations.length <= 500\n0 < stations[0][0] < stations[1][0] < ... < stations[stations.length-1][0] < target\nclass Solution:\n    def minRefuelStops(self, target: int, startFuel: int, stations: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
