This game needs a huge space, so they play it with a computer.\n\nIn this game there are n objects numbered from 1 to n arranged in a circle (in clockwise order). Object number 1 is a black hole and the others are planets. There's a monster in one of the planet. Rick and Morty don't know on which one yet, only that he's not initially in the black hole, but Unity will inform them before the game starts. But for now, they want to be prepared for every possible scenario. [Image] \n\nEach one of them has a set of numbers between 1 and n - 1 (inclusive). Rick's set is s_1 with k_1 elements and Morty's is s_2 with k_2 elements. One of them goes first and the player changes alternatively. In each player's turn, he should choose an arbitrary number like x from his set and the monster will move to his x-th next object from its current position (clockwise). If after his move the monster gets to the black hole he wins.\n\nYour task is that for each of monster's initial positions and who plays first determine if the starter wins, loses, or the game will stuck in an infinite loop. In case when player can lose or make game infinity, it more profitable to choose infinity game.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 7000) \u2014 number of objects in game.\n\nThe second line contains integer k_1 followed by k_1 distinct integers s_{1, 1}, s_{1, 2}, ..., s_{1, }k_1 \u2014 Rick's set.\n\nThe third line contains integer k_2 followed by k_2 distinct integers s_{2, 1}, s_{2, 2}, ..., s_{2, }k_2 \u2014 Morty's set\n\n1 \u2264 k_{i} \u2264 n - 1 and 1 \u2264 s_{i}, 1, s_{i}, 2, ..., s_{i}, k_{i} \u2264 n - 1 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print n - 1 words separated by spaces where i-th word is \"Win\" (without quotations) if in the scenario that Rick plays first and monster is initially in object number i + 1 he wins, \"Lose\" if he loses and \"Loop\" if the game will never end.\n\nSimilarly, in the second line print n - 1 words separated by spaces where i-th word is \"Win\" (without quotations) if in the scenario that Morty plays first and monster is initially in object number i + 1 he wins, \"Lose\" if he loses and \"Loop\" if the game will never end.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n2 3 2\n3 1 2 3\n\nOutput\nLose Win Win Loop\nLoop Win Win Win\n\nInput\n8\n4 6 2 3 4\n2 3 6\n\nOutput\nWin Win Win Win Win Win Win\nLose Win Lose Lose Win Lose Lose\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
