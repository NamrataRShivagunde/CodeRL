Chef Doesn\u2019t want to break any logs or Stick 2 or more logs together.\nTo make a  h\u2009\u00d7\u2009w Window Frame, he needs two Logs with lengths equal h and two with length . \nThe Chef wants as much sunlight in as possible and for it he has decided to make from the available logs as many frames as possible. Help him in finding the number of window Frames that he can make. \nNote : Chef do not need to use all the logs\nInput:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
