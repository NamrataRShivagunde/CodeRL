yesterday. This game is played with two variables $X$ and $Y$; initially, $X = Y = 0$. Chef may make an arbitrary number of moves (including zero). In each move, he must perform the following process:\n- Choose any positive integer $P$ such that $P \\cdot P > Y$.\n- Change $X$ to $P$.\n- Add $P \\cdot P$ to $Y$.\nUnfortunately, Chef has a bad memory and he has forgotten the moves he made. He only remembers the value of $X$ after the game finished; let's denote it by $X_f$. Can you tell him the maximum possible number of moves he could have made in the game?\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $X_f$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the maximum number of moves Chef could have made.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le X_f \\le 10^9$\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3\n3\n8\n9\n\n-----Example Output-----\n3\n5\n6\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 2: One possible sequence of values of $X$ is $0 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 8$.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
