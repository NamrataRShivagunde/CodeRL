Once the straight-line distance between the ships is greater than 40 miles, the net will tear, and their valuable sea harvest will be lost! We need to know how long it will take for this to happen.\n\nGiven the bearing of each ship, find the time **in minutes** at which the straight-line distance between the two ships reaches **40 miles**. Both ships travel at **90 miles per hour**. At time 0, assume the ships have the same location.\n\nBearings are defined as **degrees from north, counting clockwise**.\nThese will be passed to your function as integers between **0 and 359** degrees.\nRound your result to **2 decmal places**.\n\n\nIf the net never breaks, return float('inf')\n\nHappy sailing!\ndef find_time_to_break(bearing_A, bearing_B):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
