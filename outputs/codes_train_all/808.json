He loves Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) too much and he is a very curious guy. He always try to do new things. Now he want to make a large number with it. But he doesn't want to take too many numbers.\n\nHe is willing to take only three numbers less than or equal to N (not necessarily distinct ) and from those three number he want get the maximum number by taking LCM of the numbers.\n\nAs he is busy in playing some more tricks of maths, he assign this task to you.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line of input contains an integer t ( t<=1000 ), Number of test cases.\n\nt line follows an integer N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint t lines contains a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible LCM of three not necessarily distinct positive integers that are not greater than N.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n1<= N <= 10^6\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2\n9\n7\n\nOutput:\n504\n210\n\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 2. For the last example, we can chose numbers 7, 6, 5 and the LCM of them is 7\u20226\u20225\u2009=\u2009210. It is the maximum value we can get.\nUse Standard Input format\nANSWER:\n"}}
