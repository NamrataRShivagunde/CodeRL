For this, he organized an hiring event to hire some talented Chefs. He gave the following problem to test the skills of the participating Chefs. Can you solve this problem and be eligible for getting hired by Head Chef.\n\nA non-negative number n is said to be magical if it satisfies the following property. Let S denote the multi-set of numbers corresponding to the non-empty subsequences of the digits of the number n in decimal representation. Please note that the numbers in the set S can have leading zeros. Let us take an element s of the multi-set S, prod(s) denotes the product of all the digits of number s in decimal representation. \nThe number n will be called magical if sum of prod(s) for all elements s in S, is even. \n\nFor example, consider a number 246, its all possible non-empty subsequence will be S = {2, 4, 6, 24, 46, 26, 246}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {prod(2) = 2, prod(4) = 4, prod(6) = 6, prod(24) = 8, prod(46) = 24, prod(26) = 12, prod(246) = 48, i.e. {2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 12, 48}. Sum of all of these is 104, which is even. Hence 246 is a magical number.\n\nPlease note that multi-set S can contain repeated elements, e.g. if number is 55, then S = {5, 5, 55}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {prod(5) = 5, prod(5) = 5, prod(55) = 25}, i.e. {5, 5, 25}. Sum of all of these is 35 which is odd. Hence 55 is not a \nmagical number.\n\nConsider a number 204, then S = {2, 0, 4, 20, 04, 24, 204}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0}. Sum of all these elements will be 14 which is even. So 204 is a magical number.\n\nThe task was to simply find the Kth magical number.\n\n-----Input-----\n- First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\n- Each of the next T lines contains a single integer K.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single integer corresponding to the Kth magical number.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 K \u2264 1012.\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 : (20 points)\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n- 1 \u2264 K \u2264 104.\n\nSubtask 2 : (80 points) Original Constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2\n2\n5\n\nOutput:\n2\n8\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1.\n2 is the 2nd magical number, since it satisfies the property of the magical number.
