Let's get started with a simple concept in statistics: Mutually exclusive events.\n\nThe probability of an OR event is calculated by the following rule:\n\n`P(A || B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A && B)`\n\nThe probability of event A or event B happening is equal to the probability of event A plus the probability of event B minus the probability of event A and event B happening simultaneously.\n\nMutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time. For example, the head and tail results of a toin coss are mutually exclusive because they can't both happen at once. Thus, the above example for a coin toss would look like this:\n\n`P(H || T) = P(H) + P(T) - P(H && T)`\n\nNote that the probaility of tossing a coin and the result being both head and tails is 0.\n\n`P(H || T) = (0.5) + (0.5) - (0)`\n`P(H || T) = 1`\n\nThus the probability of a coin toss result being a heads or a tails is 1, in other words: certain.\n\n\nYour task:\n\nYou are going to have to work out the probability of one roll of a die returning two given outcomes, or rolls. Given that dice rolls are mutually exclusive, you will have to implement the above forumala. To make this interesting (this is a coding challenge after all), these dice are not fair and thus the probabilites of receiving each roll is different.\n\nYou will be given a two-dimensional array containing the number each of the results (1-6) of the die and the probability of that roll for example `[1 , 0.23]` as well as the two rolls for example `1` and `5`. \n\nGiven the two roll probabilities to calculate, return the probability of a single roll of the die returning either. If the total probability of the six rolls doesn't add up to one, there is a problem with the die; in this case, return null. \nReturn your result as a string to two decimal places.\n\nExample below:\n\n`1 : 1/6`\n\n`2 : 1/6`\n\n`3 : 1/6`\n\n`4 : 1/6`\n\n`5 : 1/6`\n\n`6 : 1/6`\n\nIf asked for the rolls `1` and `2` then you would need to sum the probabilities, both `1/6` therefore `2/6` and return this. As above, you will need to return it as a decimal and not a  fraction.\ndef mutually_exclusive(dice, call1, call2):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
