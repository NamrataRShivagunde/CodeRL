numbers which can be formed by sum of some numbers which are prime. Chef wrote those numbers in dairy. Cheffina came and saw what the chef was doing. Cheffina immediately closed chef's dairy and for testing chef's memory, she starts asking numbers and chef needs to answer wheater given number N can be formed by the sum of K prime numbers if it yes then print 1 else print 0. \n\n-----Input:-----\n- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases.
