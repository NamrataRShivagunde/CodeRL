Each person is labeled with a\u00a0unique ID\u00a0from\u00a00\u00a0to\u00a0n - 1.\nYou are given an integer array\u00a0groupSizes, where groupSizes[i]\u00a0is the size of the group that person\u00a0i\u00a0is in. For example, if\u00a0groupSizes[1] = 3, then\u00a0person\u00a01\u00a0must be in a\u00a0group of size\u00a03.\nReturn\u00a0a list of groups\u00a0such that\u00a0each person\u00a0i\u00a0is in a group of size\u00a0groupSizes[i].\nEach person should\u00a0appear in\u00a0exactly one group,\u00a0and every person must be in a group. If there are\u00a0multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]\nOutput: [[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]\nExplanation: \nThe first group is [5]. The size is 1, and groupSizes[5] = 1.\nThe second group is [0,1,2]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[0] = groupSizes[1] = groupSizes[2] = 3.\nThe third group is [3,4,6]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[3] = groupSizes[4] = groupSizes[6] = 3.\nOther possible solutions are [[2,1,6],[5],[0,4,3]] and [[5],[0,6,2],[4,3,1]].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: groupSizes = [2,1,3,3,3,2]\nOutput: [[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\ngroupSizes.length == n\n1 <= n\u00a0<= 500\n1 <=\u00a0groupSizes[i] <= n\nclass Solution:\n    def groupThePeople(self, groupSizes: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
