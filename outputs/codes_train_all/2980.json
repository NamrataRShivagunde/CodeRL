are: ```1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.```\nYour challenge for this kata is to find the minimum number that has a certain number of divisors.\nFor this purpose we have to create the function \n\n```find_min_num() or findMinNum() or similar in the other languages```\n\nthat receives the wanted number of divisors ```num_div```, and outputs the smallest number having an amount of divisors equals to ```num_div```.\n\nLet's see some cases:\n```\nfind_min_num(10) = 48 # divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24 and  48\nfind_min_num(12) = 60\n```\nIn this kata all the tests will be with ```numDiv < 80```\n\n(There will be a next kata with numDiv < 10000, Find the First Number Having a Certain Number of Divisors II, should have the help of number theory)\n\nEnjoy it and happy coding!\n(Memoization is advisable)\ndef find_min_num(d, n=1):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
