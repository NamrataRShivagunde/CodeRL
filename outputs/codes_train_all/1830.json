Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the nth lake, the nth lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake which is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid the flood in any lake.\nGiven an integer array rains where:\n\nrains[i] > 0 means there will be rains over the rains[i] lake.\nrains[i] == 0 means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.\n\nReturn an array ans where:\n\nans.length == rains.length\nans[i] == -1 if rains[i] > 0.\nans[i] is the lake you choose to dry in the ith day\u00a0if rains[i] == 0.\n\nIf there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.\nNotice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes. (see example 4)\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: rains = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: [-1,-1,-1,-1]\nExplanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]\nAfter the second day full lakes are [1,2]\nAfter the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]\nAfter the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]\nThere's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]\nOutput: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]\nExplanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]\nAfter the second day full lakes are [1,2]\nAfter the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]\nAfter the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.\nAfter the fifth day, full lakes are [2].\nAfter the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].\nIt is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another acceptable scenario.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: rains = [1,2,0,1,2]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: After the second day, full lakes are  [1,2]. We have to dry one lake in the third day.\nAfter that, it will rain over lakes [1,2]. It's easy to prove that no matter which lake you choose to dry in the 3rd day, the other one will flood.\n\nExample 4:\nInput: rains = [69,0,0,0,69]\nOutput: [-1,69,1,1,-1]\nExplanation: Any solution on one of the forms [-1,69,x,y,-1], [-1,x,69,y,-1] or [-1,x,y,69,-1] is acceptable where 1 <= x,y <= 10^9\n\nExample 5:\nInput: rains = [10,20,20]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: It will rain over lake 20 two consecutive days. There is no chance to dry any lake.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= rains.length <= 10^5\n0 <= rains[i] <= 10^9\nclass Solution:\n    def avoidFlood(self, rains: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        \nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
