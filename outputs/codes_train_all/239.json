1:\nInput: values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,1,2,2,3], num_wanted = 3, use_limit = 1\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: The subset chosen is the first, third, and fifth item.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: values =

= [0,0,0,1,1], num_wanted = 3, use_limit = 1\nOutput:\u00a016\nExplanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth item.\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: values = [9,8,8,7,6], labels = [0,0,0,1,1],
