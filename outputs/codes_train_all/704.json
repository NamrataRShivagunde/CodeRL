But today, he is feeling very lazy and wants to you do his homework. His homework has the following given maths problem.\nYou are given three integers: A, N, M. You write the number A appended to itself N times in a row. Let's call the resulting big number X. For example, if A = 120, N = 3, then X will be 120120120. Find out the value of X modulo M.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow.\nEach test case is described in one line containing three integers: A, N and M as described in the problem statement.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer denoting the value of X modulo M.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 105\n- 0 \u2264 A \u2264 109\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 1012\n- 2 \u2264 M \u2264 109\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (15 points):\n- 0 \u2264 A \u2264 100\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\n\nSubtask #2 (25 points):\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 109\n\nSubtask #3 (60 points):\n- Original constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2\n12 2 17\n523 3 11\n\nOutput:\n5\n6\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample 1: As A = 12, N = 2, X = 1212, 1212 modulo 17 = 5\nExample 2.
