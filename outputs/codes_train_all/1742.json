But, they won't reconcile in peace when equated with each other. To prove his might, Jon challenges Joe to write a program to find all possible number combos that sum to a given number. While unsure whether he would be able to accomplish this feat or not, Joe accpets the challenge. Being Joe's friend, your task is to help him out.\n\n# Task\n\nCreate a function `combos`, that accepts a single positive integer `num` (30 > `num` > 0) and returns an array of arrays of positive integers that sum to `num`.\n\n# Notes\n1. Sub-arrays may or may not have their elements sorted.\n2. The order of sub-arrays inside the main array does not matter.\n3. For an optimal solution, the following operation should complete within 6000ms.\n\n# Sample\ndef combos(n):\n\t\nUse Call-Based format\nANSWER:\n"}}
